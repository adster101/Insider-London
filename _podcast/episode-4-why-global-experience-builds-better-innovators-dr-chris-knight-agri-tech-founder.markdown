Our latest episode of The Knowledge Exchange features Dr Chris Knight, a researcher-turned-entrepreneur whose work spans weather prediction, crop modelling, and global agri-tech ventures. Chris has taken his PhD research and scaled it into technology that tracks fields across the world — showing how deep academic insight can become commercial innovation with global impact.

In this conversation, Chris reflects on the challenges of bridging theory and practice, the role of universities in preparing graduates for entrepreneurial paths, and how international exposure reshapes both mindset and leadership. He also shares candid thoughts on AI, remote work, and why side projects and personal passion often matter more than polished CVs.
