In this episode of The Knowledge Exchange, we speak with [Jack Harris](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jack-harris-21442a/), a sociologist, global educator and architect of international learning programmes across Asia, Europe and the United States.

Drawing on more than three decades of experience, Jack explores what truly makes international education transformative rather than touristic. From bridging academic theory with lived experience to preparing students for leadership in complex cross-cultural environments, he shares a rare practitioner’s perspective on how learning happens when students step outside the classroom.

We discuss why intentional programme design matters, how immersive experiences build resilience, curiosity and empathy, and why storytelling is now as important as credentials in a crowded graduate market shaped by AI. Jack also reflects on the changing nature of study abroad in the age of smartphones, the loss of “breakaway” experiences, and the challenge universities face in keeping students present, curious and engaged.

The conversation ranges from leadership and trust to community development in Ghana and Cuba, to what it really means to become a global citizen in a connected but increasingly distracted world.

A thoughtful and wide-ranging episode for educators, students, programme designers and anyone interested in the future of learning, leadership and global work.
