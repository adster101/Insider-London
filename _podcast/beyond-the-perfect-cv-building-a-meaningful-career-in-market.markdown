In this episode of The Knowledge Exchange, we speak with [Elizabeth Marriott](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elizabeth-marriott), a senior marketing leader who transitioned from leading marketing at one of the world’s fastest-growing independent B2B agencies to a leadership role within one of the UK’s largest media agencies.

Elizabeth shares practical insight into how graduates can bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world marketing practice — and what truly makes a candidate stand out in today’s saturated job market.

From the importance of research and curiosity to transferable skills and presentation confidence, this conversation explores how students can build meaningful careers without falling into the “perfect CV” trap.
