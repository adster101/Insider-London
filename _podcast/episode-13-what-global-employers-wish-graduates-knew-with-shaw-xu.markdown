[Shaw Xu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaw-xu-25260932/) is the President of Versus Global, a multinational logistics and supply‑chain organisation operating across major trade routes. With two decades of experience navigating global operations, talent development, and cross‑border commercial realities, Shaw brings a grounded and candid perspective on what today’s graduates need to succeed in international business.

In this episode of The Knowledge Exchange, Shaw breaks down the real gaps he sees between academic theory and the day‑to‑day demands of global commerce — from basic workplace readiness to communication, cultural awareness, and professional maturity. He explains why technical knowledge alone isn’t enough, why manners and confidence matter more than students realise, and how global exposure directly shapes performance inside supply‑chain organisations.

Shaw also reflects on shifting post‑pandemic mindsets, the changing expectations of young professionals, and the partnerships that genuinely work between universities and industry. For students, educators, and employers alike, his insights offer a clear, practical look at what it takes to thrive in one of the world’s most complex and interconnected sectors.
