In this episode of The Knowledge Exchange, we sit down with Oscar Sadler, Head of Client Strategy at Wiser, to explore whether today’s graduates are truly prepared for the realities of modern work. Drawing on his experience supporting global brands across early‑career talent, employer branding, and people insight, Oscar offers a candid look at the widening gap between academic learning and workplace expectations.

He discusses why employers are investing in “ready‑to‑work” training, how virtual learning has reshaped communication skills, and why AI is now inseparable from the graduate recruitment process. Oscar also explains what actually helps a candidate stand out when applications surge into the tens of thousands, and how Gen Z’s expectations around flexibility, culture, and transparency are reshaping employer strategy.

A sharp, honest conversation about the future of work — and what needs to change on both sides of the university–industry divide.
