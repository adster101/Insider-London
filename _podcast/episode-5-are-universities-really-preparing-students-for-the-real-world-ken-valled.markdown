We’re excited to share the latest episode of The Knowledge Exchange, featuring Ken Valledy, co‑founder of Progressive and former Brand Director at AB InBev. Ken has spent his career bridging two worlds: global corporations and the startup ecosystem. Today, he helps brands collaborate with startups to drive innovation, and he’s passionate about supporting young people in building meaningful, self‑directed careers.

In this conversation, Ken reflects on how universities can better prepare students for the realities of entrepreneurship, innovation, and global work. He shares candid insights on the persistent gap between theory and practice, the importance of international exposure, and why soft skills like communication and networking are often underestimated but critical for success.
