In this episode of The Knowledge Exchange, we sit down with Ebru Urgen, an experienced educator specialising in business English and professional communication for international students. Drawing on her corporate background in banking and years of teaching across schools and universities, Ebru shares how she helps learners bridge the gap between classroom language skills and the real communication demands of global workplaces.

We explore what makes international programmes truly transformative, why human skills matter more than ever, and how students can stand out in a crowded graduate market. Ebru also reflects on post‑pandemic expectations, the importance of in‑person interaction, and the role of study abroad in building confidence, resilience, and career readiness.

A practical, honest conversation for anyone supporting international learners — and for students navigating the transition from language study to global careers.
