In this episode of The Knowledge Exchange, we sit down with Mihai Toma, founder and CEO of New Genre, a London‑based creative studio working with ambitious brands. Mihai shares his journey from design student to studio founder, and reflects on how universities can better prepare graduates for the realities of creative work, global careers, and even launching their own businesses.

Together, we explore the gap between academic creativity and commercial practice, the importance of real‑client projects, and why resilience and global exposure are essential traits for young creatives. Mihai also challenges the myth that design graduates should only seek jobs, arguing instead that many are perfectly equipped to become CEOs and entrepreneurs.
