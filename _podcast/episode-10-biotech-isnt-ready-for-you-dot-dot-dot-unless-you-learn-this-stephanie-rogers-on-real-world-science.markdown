In this episode of *The Knowledge Exchange*, we sit down with Stephanie Rogers, a scientist working at the forefront of sustainable biology and biotech. From insect mass‑rearing to circular‑economy food systems, Stephanie’s work sits at the intersection of biology, engineering, agriculture, and innovation — and she brings a rare, candid perspective on what young scientists actually need to thrive in industry.

We explore why universities excel at teaching detail but fall short on pace, commercial awareness, and the messy realities of real‑world experimentation. Stephanie breaks down what truly makes a biology graduate stand out — from adaptability and resilience to hands‑on experience with living systems and industrial equipment — and why perfectionism can hold early‑career scientists back.

She also shares her vision for a new kind of university–industry partnership, one that exposes students to multiple sides of a system, from lab work to field studies to stakeholder needs. And we dig into the shifting motivations of young scientists today, from sustainability and planetary health to the search for meaningful, impact‑driven careers.

A grounded, insightful conversation for anyone entering biotech, food innovation, or applied science — and for educators rethinking how to prepare students for fast‑moving scientific environments.
