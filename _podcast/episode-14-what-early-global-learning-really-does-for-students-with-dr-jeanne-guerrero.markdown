# 🎙️ **Episode Overview (Jeanne Guerrero)**  
**Episode Title:** *What Early Global Learning Really Does for Students — with Dr. Jeanne Guerrero*

Dr. Jeanne Guerrero, Director of Pre‑College Programs at American University’s School of International Service, joins us to unpack what meaningful global learning looks like *before* students ever reach university. Drawing on two decades across dual‑credit programs, AP institutes, and AU’s flagship pre‑college initiatives, she explains how early exposure to diplomacy, international affairs, and diverse communities can fundamentally shift a young person’s confidence, worldview, and future pathways.

Jeanne shares how she designs programs that move beyond theory—pairing rigorous academic content with real‑world experiences like embassy visits, policy conversations, and cross‑cultural encounters. She reflects on the students who surprise her, the partnerships that transform access, and the mindset shifts young learners need as they prepare for global careers. From navigating complex issues without overwhelming students to helping them build openness, resilience, and curiosity, Jeanne offers a grounded, human perspective on what truly prepares the next generation for an interconnected world.
