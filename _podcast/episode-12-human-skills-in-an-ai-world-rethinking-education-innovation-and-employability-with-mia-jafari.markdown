[Mia Jafari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miajafari/) is an innovation strategist, founder of Fluid Labs, and a global collaborator who has worked with startups, corporates, and universities across multiple continents. In this episode of *The Knowledge Exchange*, she explores what it really takes to turn creative ideas into scalable innovations; especially in a world where AI is reshaping how we learn, work, and build.

Drawing on her experience in design, entrepreneurship, and cross‑cultural partnerships, Mia breaks down why adaptability, curiosity, and a strong sense of purpose matter more than ever. She explains why technical skills alone are no longer enough, how universities can better prepare students for uncertainty, and what makes collaborations between business and education genuinely effective.

From navigating ambiguity to building global relationships, Mia offers a grounded, human‑centred perspective on the future of innovation and what today’s graduates need to thrive in an unpredictable world.
