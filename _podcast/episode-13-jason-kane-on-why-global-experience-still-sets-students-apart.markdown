In this interview, [Jason Kane](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonkanepitt/) from the University of Pittsburgh explains why global experiences have a meaningful impact on how students navigate their careers. Drawing on years of working with Pitt’s international alumni networks, he describes how studying, interning, or working abroad pushes students out of their comfort zones and exposes them to different work cultures, expectations, and communication styles.

Jason highlights the subtle but powerful skills students develop when they operate across borders — from understanding cultural nuances to adapting to unfamiliar professional norms. These experiences, he argues, make students more employable because they learn to notice details others overlook, navigate diverse teams, and adjust quickly to new environments.

Whether comparing work styles across Asia, Europe, and Africa or sharing stories from his own early career, Jason makes a compelling case for why global exposure remains one of the strongest differentiators for young professionals today.
