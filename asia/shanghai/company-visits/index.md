Behind the glamorous skyline lies a cosmopolitan city with a long history of migration. Referred to as the melting pot of China, the French and Jewish Quarters are a testament to Shanghai’s diverse history. The modern metropolis is equally vibrant and attracts more foreign settlers than any other Chinese city.

Shanghai is prized for its sophistication and entrepreneurial flare as well as its openness and connectivity in business. One of China’s wealthiest and most populated cities, Shanghai is at the forefront of innovation in a variety of sectors and is the chosen location for China’s first free trade zone.

We offer an extensive range of company visits from media to fashion, from manufacturing to high technology. Read on to find out more.
