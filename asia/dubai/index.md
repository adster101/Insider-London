### In-Depth Session at Area 2071 and Xlab
Located in Emirates Tower, immerse yourself in the future of travel at Area 2071 and Xlab. Xlab Aviation is an ambitious funding and support programme which partners the most exciting new start-ups with experts, industry contacts and government. Confronting two challenges: airport transition time and environmental impact, Intelak provides seed funding to four winning start-ups and bridges the gap between the most game-changing ideas and viable business models which can be practically applied to the sector.

This in-depth experience will be led by the incubator manager and provides groups with the opportunity to meet the start-ups and mentors who are prototyping the future of travel.
