The re-unification of Berlin in 1990 is credited with a cultural and artistic explosion. Decades later and this creative dynamism shows no sign of slowing down. Berlin is undoubtedly one of the coolest and creative cities of current times.

A centre for media, science, and research, the German capital maintains its status as the technology hub for Europe. Excelling in the fields of biotech and cleantech, Berlin’s cutting-edge status is also shown through its progressive urban mobility infrastructure.  The enormous proportion of forests, parks and lakes in the city’s area further contributes to an outstanding quality of living.
