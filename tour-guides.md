Insider London’s guided walking tours are planned and led by our team of lovely guides. Read on to meet the team!

Driven by a keen interest in history, especially London history, Michelle works as a tour guide for Insider London alongside her work as a professional dancer. From the city’s earliest beginnings to modern day London, Michelle enjoys focusing on the history of the London Underground, Georgian London and the areas of St. James's and Piccadilly. Her tours have been featured on television, in magazines and blogs. Michelle is currently working on completing her City of Westminster badge, which will develop her knowledge to further delve into the royal and political past of London.

**Tony**

Tony was born and raised in Greenwich. Having travelled for many years to many different countries, he has developed a love for culture and knowledge and more importantly, how to see the world in a different way. Tony brings his passion, wealth of experience and extensive knowledge of London on all of his Insider London walking tours.
