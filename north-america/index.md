We present the world capital of innovation and technology: SILICON VALLEY. For the last sixty years this region has been at the heart of many of the greatest technological innovations. From microprocessors to integrated circuit boards and lasers, Silicon Valley is synonymous with high technology and scientific research, as well as the modern-day social media giants.  

With Silicon Valley attracting a third of all US venture capital and the global tech sector showing no sign of slowing, this is an unmissable opportunity to gain access to the highest-level insight.
