The number of people travelling to the UK in 2018 is expected to grow, compared to last year, the latest forecasts from [VisitBritain](https://www.visitbritain.org/forecast) suggest.

According to the organisation, there were an estimated 39.9 million visits to the UK in 2016, which was a 6.2 per cent increase over the previous 12 months. For the year ahead, this is predicted to climb again to 41.7 million visits.

There are expected to be more visitors from the likes of China, India and much of South East Asia, while traveller numbers from the US are also expected to be strong.

It may be that many of those travelling from Asian nations have not visited the UK before, and could therefore be looking for [London history tours](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/historical-walking-tours/) and other ways of discovering the many stories that can be found on the capital’s streets.

While the red buses are ever-present on London’s streets, these actually aren’t the best way to see all of the main sights. A walking tour allows you to go at a slower pace, fully appreciating the architecture of the city and giving you time to delve a little deeper into each place you visit.

These are also a great option if you’re looking for a tour that deals with a specific element of London’s past. For instance, you could head to the East End to find out more about how this part of London has been influenced by immigrants, as well as learning about its fascinating past as a haven for criminals and gangsters. 

Alternatively, you can hop on the Tube for a journey with a difference. This tour will educated you about the history of the London Underground, as well as show you a disused ‘ghost’ station that hasn’t been used for over 50 years.
