There are a lot of big changes happening in the UK at the moment, and while Brexit is rumbling on, there are now other things to be sorted out in the House of Commons before the UK’s negotiations over leaving the EU can begin properly.

Every sector is likely to be affected by Brexit in one way or another, but one area that could see a raft of changes is London’s banking sector, which is typically associated with the City of London.

Of course, the financial sector in London has evolved over centuries, and has led the way with many aspects of modern banking. Did you know, for instance, that the London Stock Exchange is one of the oldest in the world? Or that the Bank of England was a pioneer of the modern banking system?

Within the Bank of England you’ll find [a museum dedicated to its history](http://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/611007-bank-of-england-museum) and can explore how it’s changed since it was founded in 1694. It’s free to visit and offers a fascinating insight into the world of banking and trading.

But this is far from the only cultural attraction within the City of London, which is famous for much more than just its financial sector.

You can climb more than 300 steps to the top of [The Monument](http://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/100165-monument), which was designed by Sir Christopher Wren to commemorate the Great Fire of London, and marvel at the views of the skyline.

This part of the city is also home to the infamous Tower of London, best known for its tales of torture and death. However, there’s much more to this royal palace than you may first think - it is even considered to have been home to London’s first-ever zoo.

If you’re visiting the capital and want to learn more about this fascinating area of the city and its heritage, you can join a London history tour that [provides greater detail on these and many other attractions](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/london-finance-walking-tour/).
