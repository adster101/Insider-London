London is one of the most historical cities in the world, with all sorts of interesting traditions and cultural quirks t[hat you can still see today](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/). They really have stood the test of time so if you’re planning on going on walking tours in London this year, here are just a few of the very best ceremonies and parades to try and catch while in the Big Smoke.


[**Changing of the Guard**](http://changing-guard.com/dates-buckingham-palace.html)

This takes place each day from 11:00 between April and July so you’re sure to be able to see if it you’re in the city this summer. The Household Troops have guarded the Sovereign Palaces since 1660, so this is one of the longest-standing traditions you can still see today. It takes place inside the railings of Buckingham Palace’s forecourt, with Foot Guards to be seen marching in and out, accompanied by a jolly band. It’s free to watch and lasts around 45 minutes – but get there early as it always draws huge crowds.

**Horse Guards Parade**](http://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/place/484414-horse-guards-parade)

This also takes place each day at Horse Guards Parade. It lasts 25 minutes and you’ll be able to see the Guard march from Hyde Park Corner to Constitution Hill and The Mall until they reach Horse Guards Parade.

[
**State Opening of Parliament**](http://www.parliament.uk/about/how/occasions/stateopening/)

This annual ceremony dates all the way back to Medieval London and takes place each May, with those involved coming along in traditional robes and a royal procession also included, which features the State Coach. Royal bodyguards are charged with searching the cellars of the Houses of Parliament before the Queen gets there, a practice that has been ongoing since 1605 when Guy Fawkes tried to blow up Parliament.
