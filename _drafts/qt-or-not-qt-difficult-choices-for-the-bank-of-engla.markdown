We are taking a look into Quantitative Tightening (QT) which the Bank of England (BeO) has been planning to undertake to bring the UK's spiralling inflation under control. 

#### What's QT?

The easiest answer is that it is the opposite of quantitative easing (QE). Quantitative easing is a form of monetary policy used by central banks to increase the domestic money supply and spur economic activity. That's usually achieved by buying government bonds (gilts). With the high inflation due to the abundance of money in the financial markets, the BoE is looking to introduce QT by restricting the supply of money by selling those bonds.


#### Timing 
 
The timing of the QT is awkward for the Bank. As the new government is trying to stimulate the economy and borrow more to fund the planned tax cuts, the sterling has dropped in value so much that it has exposed the UK pension funds.

To save the day, the BoE began buying bonds to calm turmoil triggered by Prime Minister Liz Truss's tax cut plans which raised concerns about potentially unsustainable borrowing. The Bank introduced bond-market rescue on 28th September, to the tune of £65 billion, after gilt prices plummeted. Therefore, what we have is more QE and more cash injection into the markets; the opposite of what the BoE wants and needs to do, which is to fight inflation.

#### Mixed Messaging

BoE originally planned to start QT in early October but pushed the launch back until Oct. 31 as it launched its emergency bond-buying programme. "Ultimately the Bank of England is tasked with creating financial stability. And what they can't allow is for the bond market to be overly volatile," said Iain Stealey, CIO of fixed income at JPMorgan Asset Management.

However, the pension funds want the BoE to consider continuing the emergency bond-buying programme to Oct. 31 "and possibly beyond", the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association said.

#### Difficult Choices 

The Bank of England is caught between a rock and a hard place and might do both QE and QT at the same time as turbulent markets may force the Bank's hand on the matter and delay the QT even further until the volatility eases, and the new chancellor will deliver stability to the UK economy.
