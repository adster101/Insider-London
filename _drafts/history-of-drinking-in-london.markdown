We'll work in chronological order, so the first of the London pubs to keep your eye out for is the Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese. Sometimes cited as the oldest pub in the UK, Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese was rebuilt in 1667, following the Great Fire of London and has been known to play host to iconic literary legends such as Charles Dickens, Dr Samuel Johnson and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Polly the Parrot was also another iconic figure to visit the pub, and when she died in 1920 made the headlines. You'll now find her stuffed remains a top one of the bars. This pub provides an atmosphere of what an early coaching inn would have been like. And with the architecture, in the chop room of the pub, having remained unchanged since the late 1600s you'll even get to witness what the pub would have looked like all those years ago. The smaller rooms would have once been used by local business to sell their wears to travellers and the wealthy, whilst also providing a quite place to discuss private business.
