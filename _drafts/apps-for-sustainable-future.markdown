What if you want to be sustainable and conscientious of your purchases and the life choices you make, but don’t know where to start? It can be difficult to see through all the greenwashing, of which many retailers, manufacturers are culpable.

### Sustainable Fashion App

The fashion industry has long been under fire for unsustainable practises from recyclable materials, overproduction, environmental degradation, water consumption to unethical treatment of workers.  [Good On You](https://goodonyou.eco/) app makes it easier for consumers to shop sustainably. You can  look up a fashion brand and the app immediately tells you how sustainable it is. It does this with the use of a five-star rating system.

The [rise](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/fast-rise-slow-fashion-dress-surprise-success-story-lockdown/) of slow-fashion has been immense in the last decade with shops like [Rokit](https://www.rokit.co.uk/) selling fashionable vintage clothing that has attracted the attention of Millennials and Gen Z. [Depop](https://www.depop.com/) -  a major international platform for second-hand clothing - is a fashion marketplace app where the next generation comes to discover unique items. It makes fashion more inclusive, diverse and less wasteful. This is what transforming fashion looks like.

### Lifestyle App

London Councils, a body representing London Boroughs, is in the early stages of [adapting](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/sustainability-app-will-help-londoners-cut-their-carbon-footprint-8dtcqpt8f) an existing app from Finland called Lifestyle Test. First created in 2017, and developed by [Sitra](https://www.sitra.fi/en/topics/sustainable-everyday-life/#what-is-it-about), the app is already being used by a fifth of Finnish population and has expanded into other countries. Bringing such an app to the capital would allow Londoners to make small tweaks in their lifestyles to combat climate change.

Many of us want to change their lifestyles to reduce their carbon footprint, but don’t know what they should and shouldn't do. The overload of confusing, and sometimes contradictory information about climate change, and what constitutes a sustainable lifestyle makes people worry that they won't make the right choice. 

The app starts by estimating each individual’s yearly carbon output, split between transport, food and drink, shopping habits, housing and leisure.
Then, suggested small individual changes that are based on pieces of customised advice, can be given to each user, specifying how much of a difference each recommendation would make. This in turn will provide a great opportunity to see how the government, local authorities and businesses are enabling real sustainable choices that fit into Londoners lives.
