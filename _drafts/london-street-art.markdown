**London **\
For those wanting to see street art in the capital, Shoreditch is always the first suggestion. And with good reason. You'll find street art everywhere you look; on store fronts, on walls, up high, on the ground and even on tube carriages.  It's home to many Banksy, ROA and Thierry Noir pieces, as well as the Village Underground. This creative space of converted tube carriages and shipping containers, has been around since 2006 and remains a space where creativity and culture can thrive. As part of the Village Underground, be sure to take a look at Holywell Lane. This wall is the largest dedicated street art wall in London and every three months it is repainted by local, national and international artists.

But it's not just Shoreditch where street art is prominent in London. You'll find that Camden and Islington is where famous female street artist Bambi has taken residence with her work. And even Tower Hamlets is home to some extraordinary work in aid of the [Endangered 13](http://humannatureshow.com/endangered13/) mural project. In 2016, thirteen street artists took on a 120 metre stretch of railway arches in Tower Hamlets to create a stunning work of art to raise awareness of endangered species around the world. Louis Masai, Andy Council and Faunagraphic were just some of the artists that took part to raise awareness of this cause.
