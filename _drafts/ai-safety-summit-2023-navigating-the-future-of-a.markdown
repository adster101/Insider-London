The United Kingdom recently hosted the first global [AI Safety Summit](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2023-generative-AIs-breakout-year) on the 1st and 2nd of November at Bletchley Park. This event brought together leading AI nations, technology companies, researchers, and civil society groups to turbocharge action on the safe and responsible development of frontier AI around the world.

#### The Summit's Objectives

The summit aimed to foster a shared understanding of the risks posed by frontier AI and the need for action. It sought to establish a forward process for international collaboration on frontier AI safety, including how best to support national and international frameworks. The summit also discussed appropriate measures that individual organisations should take to increase frontier AI safety.

#### Prime Minister's Speech

The UK Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, delivered a speech at the AI Safety Summit. He emphasized that the UK has long been home to the transformative technologies of the future, and there is no better place to host the first-ever global AI safety summit than at Bletchley Park. He stressed the need to fully embrace the extraordinary opportunities of artificial intelligence, while also tackling the risks to ensure it develops safely in the years ahead.

#### Launch of the AI Safety Institute

During the summit, the Prime Minister also launched the world’s first AI Safety Institute¹. This institute is tasked with testing the safety of emerging types of AI¹. This initiative showcases how ensuring the safe development of AI will enable AI to be used for good globally.

#### Current Status of AI Development

The current state of AI development is marked by rapid growth and innovation. The latest annual McKinsey Global Survey on the current state of AI confirms the explosive growth of generative AI (gen AI) tools. Less than a year after many of these tools debuted, one-third of survey respondents say their organizations are using gen AI regularly in at least one business function. Amid recent advances, AI has risen from a topic relegated to tech employees to a focus on company leaders.

#### Trend Setters in AI

Trendsetters in the AI industry are pushing the boundaries of what's possible. Companies like [Trend Hunter](https://www.trendhunter.ai/) are utilizing big data and AI to provide the freshest, most relevant, data-driven insights for the world's smartest innovators. They offer AI keynotes, workshops, conferences and AI readiness programs. Another trendsetter is [ChatGPT](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence/risks-of-artificial-intelligence), which had 1 million users within the first five days of being available⁷.

#### AI Development

While AI promises significant benefits, it also poses potential threats. These include automation-spurred job loss, deepfakes, privacy violations, and algorithmic bias caused by bad data. There are also concerns about the use of AI by governments in surveillance of their own societies¹¹. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, has warned that AI is 'one of the biggest threats' to humanity.


The AI Safety Summit 2023 was a significant event in the field of artificial intelligence. It highlighted the importance of international collaboration in ensuring the safe and responsible development of AI. The launch of the AI Safety Institute further underscores the commitment to AI safety. As AI continues to advance rapidly, events like the AI Safety Summit are crucial in shaping the future of AI development.
