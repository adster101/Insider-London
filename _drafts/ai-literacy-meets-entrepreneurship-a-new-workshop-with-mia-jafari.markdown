Artificial intelligence is no longer confined to research labs or tech companies. As AI tools become more accessible, educators and employers alike are recognising that AI literacy is fast becoming a core skill, alongside critical thinking, creativity, and communication.

In response to these trends, we are introducing a new **AI & Entrepreneurship Workshop** led by innovation strategist [Mia Jafari](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miajafari) – a programme designed to equip young learners with cutting-edge AI skills and the human touch needed to thrive alongside smart machines.

#### AI Literacy: A New Essential in Education

Surveys consistently show strong belief among parents and educators that AI knowledge will be [essential for future careers](https://news.samsung.com/us/88-percent-us-parents-gen-alpha-gen-z-students-say-ai-crucial-to-childs-future-success-samsung-solve-for-tomorrow/), while at the same time pointing to a gap between how widely AI tools are used by students and how little structured guidance they receive in formal education. At the classroom level, generative AI tools are already being used for research, idea generation, and project development but often without students fully understanding how to use them effectively or responsibly.

This growing disconnect raises an important question: how do we teach young people to work with AI, rather than simply around it?

#### AI as a Collaborator, not a Shortcut

The conversation around AI in education has matured quickly. Early concerns focused on misuse and automation. Today, the focus is increasingly on [collaboration](https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/05/why-ai-literacy-is-now-a-core-competency-in-education/). Reports from organisations such as the World Economic Forum point out that while AI will automate certain tasks, it also increases the value of [human skills such as creativity](https://ailiteracy.institute/ai-literacy-review-march-11-2025/), judgement, adaptability, and ethical reasoning.

The same shift is happening in entrepreneurship and the creative industries. AI is now embedded across early-stage venture building: from market research and customer analysis to prototyping, design, and pitch development. Surveys of young entrepreneurs show that many already see [AI as part of their “founding team”](https://jausa.ja.org/news/press-releases/nearly-half-of-teens-interested-in-being-entrepreneurs-as-adults-likely-to-use-ai-instead-of-hiring-employees), accelerating ideas that would once have required far greater time or resources.

But this only works when AI is used intentionally. Knowing what to ask, how to evaluate outputs, and where human insight must take over is what separates meaningful innovation from surface-level automation.

#### Preparing Students for What Comes Next

For students preparing for university, internships, employment or entrepreneurial pathways, understanding AI is no longer optional. Equally, simply knowing how to use AI tools is not enough. The challenge and the opportunity lie in learning how to combine AI capabilities with human originality and clear communication.

That is why our new AI & Entrepreneurship Workshop is a practical, hands-on session designed to help students build confidence working with AI, while strengthening the skills that technology cannot replace.

The workshop focuses on one clear outcome: guiding students through the creation of a 10-slide startup pitch deck, supported by AI tools at each stage of the process.

Crucially, the emphasis is not on outsourcing thinking to AI. Students learn how to:

Use AI for structured research and idea development

Refine and challenge AI-generated outputs

Maintain originality, creativity, and narrative control

Present ideas clearly and confidently to others

#### Who Is Leading the Workshop?

The workshop is led by Mia Jafari, an innovation strategist and ecosystem builder with over 15 years of experience helping organisations and entrepreneurs translate emerging technologies into practical action.

As founder of [Fluid Labs](https://fluid-labs.com/), Mia has designed innovation programmes for global organisations including Microsoft, Accenture, GE, and The Emirates Group.

Mia is also the author of *Collaborating with Life: Awakening Human Innovation in the Age of AI*, which explores how we can shape our relationship with AI in ways that support both human creativity and long-term sustainability.

Her perspective aligns closely with the aims of this workshop: AI as a partner, not a replacement; innovation rooted in human judgement, curiosity, and purpose.
