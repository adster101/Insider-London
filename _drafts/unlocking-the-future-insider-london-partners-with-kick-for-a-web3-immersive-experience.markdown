At Insider London, we proudly announce our new partnership with [Kick](https://www.kickweb3.io/), a cutting-edge company at the forefront of the Web3 revolution. As part of our [London Programme](https://www.insiderlondon.com/london/), we recently hosted a company visit at [Level 39](https://level39.co/), a premier fintech and tech innovation hub in Canary Wharf. During this exclusive session, we enjoyed hearing from **Donna Chen**, Co-Founder & COO of Kick. Donna, an expert in Web3 and crypto marketing, shared valuable insights into the evolution of Web3, blockchain, and cryptocurrencies and how they reshape industries, particularly marketing and digital engagement.

#### A New Era: The Evolution from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0

Donna took us on a journey through the history of the internet, explaining how Web 1.0 consisted of static, read-only pages while Web 2.0 introduced user-generated content, social media, and e-commerce. Nowadays, Web 3.0 is revolutionising digital interaction through decentralisation, blockchain technology, and user ownership. Unlike previous models where corporations controlled platforms and data, Web 3.0 empowers users as stakeholders, providing them with decision-making power and financial incentives through mechanisms like **DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), and DeFi (Decentralized Finance).**

#### Real-World Applications: How Web3 Transformed Digital Marketing

Drawing from her career journey, Donna highlighted how **Web3 broke the traditional Web2 marketing playbook.** The shift towards **community-first strategies** means that brands no longer rely on corporate 'push marketing' but instead foster tight-knit, loyal communities. She highlighted key takeaways for students, including:

- **Community-Led Growth:** Success in Web3 depends on building engaged and active user bases rather than one-directional advertising. 
- **Storytelling and Education:** The rise of immersive storytelling through NFTs and the metaverse creates deeper audience engagement.
- **User Ownership:** In Web3, users aren’t just customers; they are stakeholders who help shape the direction of projects.

These changes demand new skill sets, particularly in marketing, communications, and branding strategies tailored for decentralised ecosystems.

#### What Kick Does and Their Impact

Donna provided an overview of [Kick’s expertise](https://www.kickweb3.io/expertise) and how the company supports brands in navigating the Web3 landscape. Kick specialises in **community growth, decentralised technology solutions, and Web3 strategy development.** Their team has worked on numerous high-profile projects, including NFT launches, blockchain integrations, and metaverse activations, as showcased in their [portfolio](https://www.kickweb3.io/projects).

For students interested in digital marketing, blockchain, and fintech, understanding how companies like Kick **bridge the gap between traditional industries and emerging Web3 technologies** is essential. Donna demonstrated how metaverse environments **enhance online interaction, create virtual economies, and redefine how brands connect with users.** This discussion sparked a lively Q&A session, during which students explored the intersection of blockchain, data privacy, and immersive digital spaces.

This visit provided a rare, hands-on learning experience for students from diverse fields, including computer science, marketing, business strategy, and finance.
