We are thrilled to announce our partnership with [Pall Mall Investments](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pall-mall-investments-international/about/), a leader in the UK's dynamic startup ecosystem. As a key player in fostering innovation and growth, Pall Mall Investments specialises in helping companies raise significant capital, connect with investors, and navigate the complexities of scaling a business. Their expertise in sectors ranging from tech and AI to manufacturing makes them an invaluable resource for entrepreneurs and investors alike.

This week we are bringing you an exclusive interview with the dynamic Co-CEOs of Pall Mall Investments, [Vanessa Fu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanessa-fu-04617231/) [Ben Armstrong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benarmstrong50/). 


**IL: Hi Ben/Vanessa, thanks for your time talking to our groups, can you tell us a bit more about Pall Mall Investments and its pivotal role in the vibrant startups scene in the UK?**

**PMI**: At our core, we are involved in helping companies raise capital in the region of £500k - £20m. We act as an introducer and carefully match the company raising with suitable investors from both UK and overseas. We have always enjoyed working with a variety of startup companies covering sectors from automotive to pharma to telecoms and lots in between. Additionally, we are strongly involved in the Innovator visa category and work directly with the Home Office as a Legacy Endorsing body. This has helped us meet hugely successful entrepreneurs from all over the world. In general terms, they have made their fortunes in their home countries and now, with our help and guidance, are looking to replicate that success in the UK.
 
**IL: From the published data over the past decades, London is the leading hub for attracting investment and talents from overseas, Pall Mall Investments Team have the extensive experience in the sectors, can you tell us a bit more about the type of startups you are working with and the rising stars in the coming years?**

**PMI:** We work with an eclectic bunch of startups in all sectors of industry , clearly  this includes lots of tech based business most of which have a strong narrative in the AI area. Having said that we also work with many companies who are manufacturers or service providers in a more generic sense. We are not simply looking for the next unicorn business but ultimately interested in those who will show steady growth and achieve a 10x exit in 7-10 years. “Slow and steady wins the race!”

**IL: Do you have any advice for the entreprenurs as how to attract investment and stay ahead of curve in terms of innovation and execution?**

**PMI:** Make sure your numbers are strong and stand up to scrutiny , make sure you are capable of justifying each line and do not make claims you cannot support. Your first 2 years projections are what counts , even that is speculative at best but Y3 , 4 and 5 are just impossible to predict. People buy people so make sure you present well make sure the investors like you first of all , the rest can then follow.


**IL: Entrepreneurship is now taught in many universities around the world, do you have any advice for students wanting to start their own businesses in the near future?**

**PMI:** Make sure you bother to write a full business plan including forecast figures for first 3 years. This is more for yourself at this point. Once you have this try and pick it apart , invite friends / colleagues to do the same. Its all about finding a gap in the market but also finding a market in the gap.
 
**IL:We all know the access to talents is equally important as the access to the market, what kind of strategies will you recommend?**

**PMI:** Without doubt the best talent is always homegrown. Bring people in at the graduate level and train and mentor them. It is time consuming and risky but the results are extraordinary.

**IL:What’s the future vision of Pall Mall Investments?**

**PMI:** Attracting more global entrepreneurs to the UK , helping them grow , develop and mature but at the same time making sure they are doing this with integrity and honesty.
