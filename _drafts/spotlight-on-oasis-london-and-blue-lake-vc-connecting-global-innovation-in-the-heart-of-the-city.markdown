At Insider London, we are excited to announce a new partnership with [Oasis London](https://www.oasislondon.co.uk/), a vibrant centre for founders, investors, and innovators created by [Blue Lake VC](https://www.bluelakevc.com/). This recent addition to our company visits offers students, entrepreneurs, and professionals a unique opportunity to explore London’s growing startup scene, where global ideas connect with local opportunities.

#### London’s Startup Scene: Global Ambitions, Local Challenges

London stands as one of the world’s foremost startup capitals, boasting over [500 venture capital](https://www.beauhurst.com/blog/most-active-venture-capital-firms-in-london/) firms and thousands of active startups. The city consistently attracts a diverse array of international founders eager to scale their ideas. Its distinctive blend of innovation, finance, and talent positions it as a global epicentre for entrepreneurship. In 2023, the city’s startup ecosystem raised approximately [$12.9 billion across various sectors](https://visible.vc/blog/venture-capital-firms-in-london/). However, the journey to success is not without its obstacles.

Entrepreneurs in London face intense competition, funding challenges, and ever-evolving regulations, all while striving to develop products that resonate within a global market. For international founders, navigating cultural differences, dealing with immigration complexities, and building a network in a new country can be particularly daunting. This is where organisations like Oasis London and Blue Lake VC offer invaluable support, playing a transformative role in helping entrepreneurs overcome these hurdles.

#### Oasis and Blue Lake VC: Empowering Global Founders

Oasis London, founded by Blue Lake VC, stands as a powerful hub and a vibrant community that empowers immigrant and international founders. Blue Lake VC specialises in championing early-stage investment, supporting ambitious entrepreneurs who are shaping scalable businesses with global reach.

Together, they create a bridge between founders and investors, nurturing innovation and connecting global talent to London’s dynamic tech ecosystem.

Each day, the venue fosters interactions among venture capitalists, startup teams, and innovators, providing invaluable insights into how London leads the way in global innovation.

#### Workshops for Students and Professionals

Through Insider London, groups can now engage directly with the Oasis and Blue Lake VC community. These sessions are designed to bring theory to life and inspire a new generation of entrepreneurs and innovators.

For students, hands-on workshops explore key areas of entrepreneurship and venture creation.

For corporate and delegate groups, the focus shifts toward collaboration and innovation strategy. Topics include how established companies can partner with startups, adapt to disruption, and adopt an agile innovation mindset. Many sessions are led by Blue Lake VC’s team or experienced founders from within the Oasis network, ensuring every discussion is grounded in real-world insight.

Each session is interactive, inspiring, and shaped by London’s fast-evolving entrepreneurial landscape — an opportunity to experience the energy of a live innovation hub at the centre of the UK’s startup scene.
