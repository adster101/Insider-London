I've been working on a project called Tech City Shoreditch which I wanted to run by you. At the moment it hasn't been published anywhere. It's an interactive map which illustrates the diversity of business and enterprise in Shoreditch.

Each pin on the interactive map represents an HQ or main office of a company. We’ve picked a selection of some of the most notable enterprises and startups in the area. (Plus there's some nifty filtering you can do)

\\ And that’s just once of the many examples of how London’s skyline could have developed into something so much different to what we know today. Flexi Offices have now designed this fun [Interactive London Skyline](http://www.flexioffices.co.uk/london-skyline/), which enables you to not only imagine, but see what the city would have looked like had certain buildings been built. You’ll be able to discover more about the buildings in Central London, ranging from those that were proposed, approved and completed, or those that unfortunately never made the cut and were cancelled before construction began.

And if you want to learn more about the cities tech companies, why not join our [Silicon Roundabout and Tech City Tour](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/silicon-roundabout-and-tech-city-tour/)?
