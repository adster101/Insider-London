East London is the corner of the capital known to be the hub of digital and technological innovation. The companies and start-ups who have made it home enjoy financial investment and world-class talent, along with all the trappings of a global city. We’ve mapped these organisations to show how versatile the area surrounding Silicon Roundabout really is.

And to represent this, The Stage Shoreditch have now designed this [interactive map](http://www.thestageshoreditch.com/tech-city-shoreditch) of the area. Each mark on the map represents an HQ or main office of a company. By looking at the photo above, you'll see in the photo above that each pin point marks a notable business or start up from this area. To make it easier for you to search, you can filter companies by sector, type, size, founded and startup. 

By clicking on a company this map provides you will information about each company, including number of employees, the address, the logo, the type of business that it is, as well as their website and social media handles.
