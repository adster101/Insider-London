A group of London tour guides are aiming to raise £20,000 for the MS Trust in 20 hours by offering guided tours of the City of London.

There will be around 45 guided tours throughout the day on Thursday 25 May, starting with 6am tours of Smithfield Market.
You can join one of the tours from just £20 and get unique insights into the City’s architecture, history and customs from an experienced and qualified guide. There will be opportunities to explore the City by bicycle as well as on foot, and there will be tours tailor-made for wheelchair users or people with visual impairment.
