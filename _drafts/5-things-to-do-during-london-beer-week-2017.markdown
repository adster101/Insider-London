3\. Spirit of Prague

**The Beer Edit will run across three days of LBW, Thursday 16th - Saturday 18th March. It's taking over the entire Oval Space in East London, creating an incredible beer village just off Hackney Road, which is a mere ten minutes walk from Bethnal Green tube station making it a super accessible journey to this beer-filled destination. Book a ticket for the session you want, rock up and make a beeline for your favourite brew, get merry with mates and even discover new beers to love.**
