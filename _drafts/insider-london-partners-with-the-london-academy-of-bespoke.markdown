*We are pleased to announce a new partnership with [The London Academy of Bespoke (LAB)](https://labacademy.co.uk/) on Savile Row*

#### Craftsmanship as the New Luxury

Craftsmanship and heritage are now valuable marketing tools. Shoppers, particularly luxury buyers, value authenticity and appreciate the narratives behind products. This shift transforms traditional craftsmanship into a strategic asset for brands.

**Savile Row’s** recent revival shows how [craftsmanship has been re-marketed as luxury](https://www.luxurytribune.com/en/the-modern-tailors-revitalising-savile-row). Modern tailors with their legacy houses and newer names alike are celebrating cut, canvas and handwork in public ways, while media projects have surfaced the diverse craftspeople sustaining the Row. These stories have helped revalue the practice as **cultural capital, not just trade skill**.

Where bespoke once meant functional workwear for officers and professionals, today it represents *time, precision and personal connection* — the same intangible qualities luxury consumers crave. Savile Row demonstrates how **craft knowledge, scarcity, and service ritual** can be repositioned as the ultimate brand differentiators.

#### The London Academy of Bespoke: Learning by Doing

At **The London Academy of Bespoke**, Insider London groups experience this transformation firsthand.

Our new partnership offers two complementary experiences:

* A **hands-on workshop** introducing students to the stitch-by-stitch logic of bespoke — exploring the stitch library, canvas samples and construction techniques.
* A **company visit** explaining how a bespoke garment is created from measurement to finish, complete with a Q&A about industry structure and contemporary tailoring brands.

Both sessions are led by a member of the senior management; these experiences translate technical craft into strategic lessons for **luxury managers and students** — showing how process creates credibility, how service and ritual create scarcity, and how storytelling around provenance raises perceived value.
