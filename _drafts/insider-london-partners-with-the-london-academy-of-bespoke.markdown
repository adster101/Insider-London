*We are pleased to announce a new partnership with [The London Academy of Bespoke (LAB)](https://labacademy.co.uk/) on Savile Row*

#### The Changing Face of the West End

The West End has been quietly reinventing itself since COVID. Where the pandemic exposed the limits of sheer footfall and concessions, the last five years have seen a purposeful pivot: landlords and flagship brands have doubled down on **place quality**, experience and storytelling.

The Crown Estate and Westminster Council have been working on a long-term public-realm[ vision](https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/our-business/property-and-places/regent-street?utm_source) for Regent Street by widening pavements, greening the route and reframing it as a flagship “brand corridor” rather than just another high street.

That repositioning matters because location now acts like a halo: a mid-market label on Regent Street or Bond Street immediately reads as elevated, simply by association. At the same time, other corners of the West End have doubled down on differentiated offers; Carnaby keeps the youthful creative edge; Bond Street keeps the silent, architectural glamour; Liberty and Fortnum & Mason trade on curated heritage and ritual. Together, these contrasting place-brands make the West End a **living laboratory for contemporary luxury strategy**.

#### Craftsmanship as the New Luxury

Two threads stand out in the West End’s post-pandemic revival.

**First, experiential retail.** Stores are increasingly theatres for brand stories — immersive windows, seasonal installations, in-store salons and dining tie-ins that visit feel like cultural attendance rather than a transaction.

**Second, craft and heritage as marketing currency.** Shoppers — especially luxury buyers — now prize provenance and making stories. That shift turns formerly technical trades into strategic brand assets.

**Savile Row’s** recent revival shows how [craftsmanship has been re-marketed as luxury](https://www.luxurytribune.com/en/the-modern-tailors-revitalising-savile-row). Modern tailors with their legacy houses and newer names alike are celebrating cut, canvas and handwork in public ways, while media projects have surfaced the diverse craftspeople sustaining the Row. These stories have helped revalue the practice as **cultural capital, not just trade skill**.

Where bespoke once meant functional workwear for officers and professionals, today it represents *time, precision and personal connection* — the same intangible qualities luxury consumers crave. Savile Row demonstrates how **craft knowledge, scarcity, and service ritual** can be repositioned as the ultimate brand differentiators.

#### The London Academy of Bespoke: Learning by Doing

At **The London Academy of Bespoke**, Insider London groups experience this transformation firsthand.

Our new partnership offers two complementary experiences:

* A **hands-on workshop** introducing students to the stitch-by-stitch logic of bespoke — exploring the stitch library, canvas samples and construction techniques.
* A **company visit** explaining how a bespoke garment is created from measurement to finish, complete with a Q&A about industry structure and contemporary tailoring brands.

Both sessions are led by **Victoria Townsend**, Savile Row’s first tailor to receive multiple Bespoke qualifications and a passionate educator who has trained with Richard James and worked with heritage brands such as **DAKS**.

These experiences translate technical craft into strategic lessons for **luxury managers and students** — showing how process creates credibility, how service and ritual create scarcity, and how storytelling around provenance raises perceived value. 

#### Who It’s For

This partnership is ideal for **business, fashion, and luxury-management students**, as well as professionals keen to understand how craftsmanship underpins brand storytelling.

The West End now offers a complete learning journey:

* From **flagship brand theatre** on Regent Street,
* Through **creative heritage** at Liberty,
* To **craft authenticity** on Savile Row.

Each stop reinforces how luxury value is created — from architecture to stitching.
