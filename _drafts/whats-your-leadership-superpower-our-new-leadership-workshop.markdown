*We are introducing a new interactive leadership workshop with Ken Valledy. This discovery-focused session guides students to identify and name their existing strengths, then transform them into confident, workplace‑ready behaviours.*

#### Leadership Superpowers

“What’s your leadership superpower?” It’s a simple question — and the exact one that changed the room when students from Texas Tech joined Ken Valedy’s leadership workshop last week. Most arrived unsure. By the final reflection, they were naming strengths out loud, standing taller, and speaking with a new clarity about what they bring to a team.

Ken’s session isn’t a leadership lecture. It’s a guided discovery. Drawing on more than 15 years in brand leadership at global companies and the hands‑on lessons of building and selling his own business, Ken creates a space where students test ideas, receive honest peer feedback, and see themselves differently. That combination of corporate rigour and entrepreneurial grit is the engine behind the transformation we saw.

#### Confidence through practice

The workshop is built around doing, not just listening. Students worked together on practical challenges, reflected on how they reacted, and then reframed those reactions as strengths. What looked like hesitation in the morning became thoughtful decision‑making by the afternoon. Quiet contributors discovered that their calm under pressure was a leadership asset. Fast thinkers learned how to channel speed into strategic clarity.

This is where confidence grows: not from praise, but from repeated, supported practice. Participants left with language to describe their strengths, examples they could use in interviews, and a clearer sense of how to show up in teams and workplaces.

#### Self-discovery that sticks

What makes this workshop different is the focus on identity as much as skill. Ken’s stories from corporate boardrooms and startup pivots aren’t just anecdotes — they’re mirrors. Students see how the same trait can be an advantage in one context and a liability in another, and they learn how to adapt without losing what makes them effective.

The result is practical and personal. Students don’t just walk away with a checklist; they leave with a named superpower, a short narrative about when it matters, and a plan to use it. That shift — from uncertainty to ownership — is what employers notice.

#### Ready for your cohort

If you want your students to build confidence, discover hidden strengths, and leave with tangible examples of leadership, this workshop scales to fit study abroad groups, leadership modules, and professional development programmes.
