We’re thrilled to introduce [Blue Garage](https://www.bluegarage.org/), the UK’s largest *makerspace* — and one of the most exciting additions to Insider London’s company visit portfolio. Located in Lewisham, Southeast London, Blue Garage is not just another workspace; it’s a creative powerhouse where ideas are turned into reality.

#### What Is a Makerspace?

A *makerspace* is a collaborative environment where people with shared interests — particularly in science, technology, engineering, art, and design — can meet to work on projects, share knowledge, and use specialised equipment. Think of it as a cross between a workshop, an innovation lab, and a community hub. Blue Garage takes this concept to the next level by combining industrial-scale tools, flexible workspace, and business support — all under one roof.

#### The Story Behind Blue Garage

Blue Garage was founded by **Michael Korn**, a Cambridge and Royal College of Art graduate who previously built [KwickScreen](https://www.kwickscreen.com/), a now widely used NHS innovation. His own struggles as a hardware entrepreneur inspired him to create the kind of place he wished had existed — a supportive, collaborative environment that bridges the gap between prototype and production.

The 38,000 sq ft facility includes high-end fabrication equipment, from CNC routers to 3D printers and textile labs, as well as coworking studios and assembly areas. It’s a unique ecosystem that removes the barriers many innovators face — such as limited space, lack of funding, or access to industrial tools — enabling startups to grow without leaving London.

#### Why Blue Garage Matters for Innovation

Blue Garage tackles one of the toughest challenges in product development — turning great ideas into scalable businesses. Often, early-stage startups face what’s known as the “valley of death,” when prototypes stall before reaching the market. Blue Garage provides the infrastructure and mentorship to overcome this stage, making it a vital part of the UK’s innovation ecosystem.

Members here include cutting-edge companies such as **Teslasuit** (creating haptic feedback wearables), **Plumis** (fire safety technology), and **Nodum** (EV charging solutions). This mix of industries shows how engineering, design, and entrepreneurship come together to drive progress in sustainability, manufacturing, and tech.
