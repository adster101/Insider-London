Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries worldwide, and voice synthesis technology is playing a key role in this change, impacting media, entertainment, marketing, and healthcare accessibility. At Insider London, we are excited to announce our partnership with [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/), a London-based innovator at the forefront of AI-driven voice synthesis. This collaboration allows us to organise company visits that provide a behind-the-scenes look at the future of digital communication and creative innovation.

#### The Story Behind ElevenLabs

Founded in 2022 by CEO Mateusz Jakub Staniszewski and CTO Piotr Dąbkowski, ElevenLabs has rapidly emerged as a leader in the field. Their mission is to make spoken content universally accessible in any language and voice, offering text-to-speech tools that produce highly customisable, human-like voices. In August 2024, ElevenLabs established its European headquarters at 119 Wardour Street in London's Soho district, marking a significant milestone in their expansion. By January 2025, the company had secured $180 million in a Series C funding round, co-led by Andreessen Horowitz and Iconiq Growth, elevating its valuation to $3.3 billion. This investment is driving further research into more expressive and controllable voice AI, the development of new products, and the expansion of their toolset for developers and businesses.

#### ElevenLabs' Cutting-Edge Work

ElevenLabs’ innovative technology has already been put to work on several high-profile projects. Their AI-powered translations were featured in Lex Fridman’s three-hour interview with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, delivering translations in English, Ukrainian, and Russian while preserving the President's unique voice and intonations. In addition, the company’s collaborations with major publishers such as *The New Yorker*, *The Washington Post*, and *The Atlantic*, as well as with gaming studios like Paradox and Cloud Imperium Games, underscore the versatility and impact of their voice synthesis solutions. Alongside these projects, ElevenLabs is dedicated to ethical AI practices by developing tools to detect AI-generated voices and ensuring responsible deployment of their technology.
