Last Saturday and Sunday, 19th and 20th of August, we ran our first tours for the fundraiser for Guide Dogs. So far, we ran three tours and thanks to our great guests, we were able to **raise over £600**! Due to the popularity of the tours, and to raise as much money as possible, we decided to add even more tours to the fundraiser than previously planned. If you want to explore London and support charity at the same time, make sure to book a space on one of the tours on the bank holiday weekend by sending an email to [jonas@insider-london.co.uk](mailto:jonas@insider-london.co.uk). The upcoming tours are:

Richard, tour guide with Insider London and the one that lead Sunday's Death and Debauchery Tour, said: “It’s great to see how our guests enjoy our tours! To know, that every penny they paid goes to a good cause – Guide Dogs’ services and their great campaigns – makes it even more rewarding!”

Dave Kent, Community Engagement Officer at Guide Dogs’ London office and a guide dog owner himself, has done a London Underground and Tube Tour with Jonas prior to the fundraiser, to ensure that the tours are suitable for blind and partially sighted people: “We’re really happy that Insider London is doing this fundraiser! I’m a history lover myself and I thoroughly enjoyed their tour. At Guide Dogs, we’re constantly working towards blind and partially sighted people having the same freedom and mobility as sighted people. It’s great that Insider London are joining us on our mission!”

And we do so happily! If you want to support Guide Dogs as well, make sure to subscribe to their newsletter [here](http://www.guidedogs.org.uk/aboutus/staying-in-touch/email-updates), and join us on one of our fundraising tours.
