#### Standout Features Redefining Learning

What set our programme apart is its commitment to diverse teaching methodologies and an emphasis on experiential learning. Small class sizes ensure a high-quality educational experience where each student receives personalised attention, making learning Mandarin more practical and applicable. Our [corporate visits](https://insiderlondon.com/asia/shanghai/company-visits/) don't just observe but immerse students in the intricacies of the Chinese business environment, facilitating interaction with industry experts and broadening perspectives.

At the core of our **Shanghai Programme** is a digitally proficient project team with twelve years of experience managing international exchange programmes.

#### Beyond the Classroom: Cultural Experiences Unveiled

As part of the programme, students will delve into Shanghai's cultural riches through a series of meticulously planned activities. A guided tour of the iconic **Bund and Pudong Financial Centres** unveils the historical and modern architectural contrasts of Shanghai. Exploring [Yu Garden](https://www.chinahighlights.com/shanghai/attraction/yuyuan-garden.htm) provides insights into traditional Chinese architecture, while a Huangpu River Night Cruise presents the city's illuminated skyline.

Day trips to ancient water towns like Zhujiajiao and historical sites such as Guangfulin further enrich the cultural tapestry. Engaging in a Chinese calligraphy workshop and participating in a simulated marketplace, where students act as buyers in Best Buyer, ensures a blend of tradition and modernity.

#### Dine with Locals and Savor Shanghai's Flavours

Our Chinese Table experience is an inspiring opportunity for students to immerse themselves in the heart of Shanghai and foster cross-cultural understanding. By dining with locals, listening to their stories and enjoying traditional meals, students can explore the beauty of different cultures and enrich their own life experiences. Additionally, the Best Food Review activity offers gastronomic adventurers the chance to explore new tastes and articulate their experiences in Mandarin through food reviews, making even the simple act of dining a journey of cultural exploration..
