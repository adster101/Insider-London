For three days (Thursday 16th- Saturday 18th March) this fantastic beer village will be taking over the Oval Space in East London.

**4. Visit a brewery**

With the craft beer scene in the UK picking up pace over the last few years, the capital have jumped on board and have opened the doors to a number of breweries around the city. Heading north of London? Check out Beavertown Brewery or the London Brewing Co.  Or if you're looking for a brewery in the east why not try Walthamstow's Wild Card Brewery? The Big Smoke Brew Co is great for those in the south and looking for a vegan friendly beer and those in the west you should head to Fuller's Brewery. 

**5. Sample a beer or two**

As part of London Beer Week a number of bars around the city will be offering drinks deals for the entire week. From pints of cask ale at St Barts Brewery to a beer based cocktail menu at Company Below.
