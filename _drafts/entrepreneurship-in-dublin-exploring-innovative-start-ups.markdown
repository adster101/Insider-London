Dublin has established itself as a hub for innovation, attracting entrepreneurs from around the world. The city is home to many resources that support the growth of start-ups, including the Guinness Enterprise Centre (GEC). In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at two Dublin-based companies, Mobility Mojo and HaPPE Earth, that are making waves in the tech and sustainability sectors.

#### The Guinness Enterprise Centre: Fostering Innovation and Growth

The [Guinness Enterprise Centre](https://www.gec.ie/) (GEC) is an award-winning business incubator that has been providing support for start-ups and entrepreneurs for over 20 years. Located in the heart of Dublin's Liberties area, the GEC is housed in a beautifully restored 19th century building, and offers a range of resources and services including office space, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help entrepreneurs grow and succeed.

The GEC has played a pivotal role in the success of many start-ups in Dublin, including Mobility Mojo and HaPPE Earth. The GEC's commitment to fostering innovation and social responsibility has helped to launch and grow some of the most successful and innovative businesses in the city.


#### The GEC and Hospital Partnerships: Empowering Innovation in Healthcare

In addition to supporting start-ups in a range of industries, the GEC has also been instrumental in fostering innovation in healthcare. Through partnerships with local hospitals, the GEC has provided support and resources to entrepreneurs and start-ups working on cutting-edge healthcare solutions.

These partnerships have led to the development of innovative healthcare technologies and solutions, including digital health platforms and medical devices. By supporting entrepreneurs and start-ups working in healthcare, the GEC is helping to drive innovation and improve healthcare outcomes in Dublin and beyond.

#### Mobility Mojo: Revolutionising Accessible Tourism

[Mobility Mojo](https://www.mobilitymojo.com/) is a company changing the face of accessible tourism. The company was founded by husband-and-wife team, Rónán and Ivana O'Driscoll, after they recognised a gap in the market for accessible travel guides that were both comprehensive and user-friendly.

What sets Mobility Mojo apart from other travel guides is that the information provided is based on first-hand experiences of wheelchair users, ensuring that the information is accurate and reliable. The company's guides cover everything from accommodation and transportation to local attractions and dining options. Mobility Mojo's commitment to accessibility and inclusion is reflected not only in their product, but also in their presence in the regenerated area of Dublin, where they actively support the local community.

##### HaPPE Earth: Sustainability in Action

[HaPPE Earth](https://happeearth.ie) is a start-up that is taking sustainability to the next level. The company produces sustainable and eco-friendly personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, gloves and gowns. HaPPE Earth's mission is to create products that are not only safe and effective, but also environmentally responsible.

HaPPE Earth's products are made from sustainable materials such as bamboo and recycled polyester, and are designed to be reused and recycled. The company's commitment to sustainability is reflected not only in their products, but also in their manufacturing process and supply chain. By prioritising sustainability at every stage of their operations, HaPPE Earth is setting a new standard for the PPE industry.
