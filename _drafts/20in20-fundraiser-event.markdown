Last Thursday we joined 20in20, along with a number of other companies, in raising money and awareness for MS Trust. The aim was to raise  £20,000 for the trust in just 20 hours, by offering guided tours around the London for a small fee.

Ans Vaessen, one of the Insider London tour guides, who was diagnosed with MS nearly ten years ago started this initiative, speaking about the event she said, 

> It was amazing to see so many people enjoying a walk or cycle tour. Some of them never had a tour before and everybody learned something new. We raised not only £10,000 but we also raised awareness for multiple sclerosis and the MS Trust. A very nice side effect is that we raised awareness for guided tours as well. And the great variety of tours available.

The event was a great success and like Ans said raised over £10,000 with donations still coming in. A short video was created and shows the huge variation of tours that took place throughout the day. If you'd like to watch it please see [here](https://www.wevideo.com/hub#view/930216281). 

Heleen van Schoonhoven- whose father suffers with the disease too, was also behind the initiative and she shared her thoughts with us after Thursday's fantastic events,

> It was heartwarming to see the involvement of the guides and participants. Besides that the amount is great, it's great that we created awareness for ms . I hope this event that included tours accessible for ms patients gives strength, and that they have experienced that they are not alone.

For the final total amount raised during the 20in20 fundraiser, please check their [website](https://www.20in20.london) as this will be announced soon.
