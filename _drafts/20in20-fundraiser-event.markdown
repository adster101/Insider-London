Ans It was amazing to see so many people enjoying a walk or cycle tour. Some of them never did one before and everybody learned something new. We raised not only Â£10,000 but we also raised awareness for multiple sclerosis and the MS Trust. A very nice side effect is that we raised awareness for guided tours as well. And the great variety of tours available.

Heleen said:Heartwarming to see the involvement of the guides and participants. Besides that the amount is great, it's great that we created awareness for ms . I hope this event that included tours accessible for ms patients gives strength, and that they have experienced that they are not alone.
