Recently, as part of Insider London’s [Tokyo Programme](https://www.insiderlondon.com/asia/tokyo/), students from **Clemson University** had an exclusive opportunity to visit the [Sankei News](https://www.sankei.com/) offices. The visit included a detailed presentation, a candid Q&A session with senior editors and journalists, and a behind-the-scenes tour of the editorial department. To capture the breadth of their experience, our team developed a comprehensive questionnaire that covers key facets of modern journalism and media operations in Japan.

#### Journalism & Media Operations

Located in the heart of Tokyo, Sankei News is one of Japan’s most respected newspapers, renowned for its commitment to accurate reporting and in-depth analysis of national and international affairs. Established as part of The Sankei Shimbun Group, which dates back to 1933, Sankei News has evolved into a comprehensive digital media platform that combines traditional journalism with modern technology. The newspaper’s editorial ethos combines rigorous fact-checking with thoughtful commentary, making it a trusted source for readers around the world.

One of the first topics explored was the **biggest challenges Japanese media faces today, especially in the digital age**. Sankei News editors emphasised the tension between maintaining journalistic integrity and the pressure to deliver timely updates. In breaking news situations, **speed and accuracy must be balanced**, a challenge that demands robust verification protocols and agile editorial workflows.

Students also probed the role of **traditional media in an era dominated by social media**. Sankei News continues to play a critical role in investigative journalism and thoughtful analysis, even as social platforms deliver instant—but often unchecked—information. The newspaper’s reputation for reliability and depth positions it as a counterbalance to the rapid-fire news cycle.

#### International Perspectives & Technology

Given the global reach of today’s news, questions about **U.S.-Japan relations** and **differences in media perspectives** sparked lively discussion. Sankei journalists explained how coverage varies between American and Japanese outlets, reflecting cultural norms and editorial priorities. The students learned about **partnerships with Western media**—from joint reporting projects to content-sharing agreements—that enable Sankei to enrich its international reporting.


The rise of **digital platforms** has fundamentally changed Sankei’s approach to news delivery. The editorial team showcased their mobile app and digital subscription model designed to engage younger audiences who consume news on smartphones and tablets. When asked about **AI and data journalism**, editors described pilot projects that leverage machine learning to analyse large datasets, identify trends, and even generate data-driven news summaries—tools that maintain the human touch while enhancing efficiency.


The visit concluded with insights into **Japanese media culture**, particularly the practice of **nemawashi**—a consensus-building approach to corporate decision-making. Students learned how this tradition shapes editorial meetings and ensures that diverse perspectives are considered before publishing. The conversation underscored the importance of cultural understanding in global journalism.

#### A Memorable Keepsake

To mark the occasion, Sankei News printed a special bulletin summarising the visit and featuring each student’s name. This thoughtful gesture allowed participants to take home a tangible reminder of their experience and the knowledge they gained.
