At Insider London, we’re delighted to announce our partnership with the Chiba Institute of Technology (CIT), Japan’s oldest private technical university. As part of our Tokyo Programme, we recently hosted an interactive visit that showcased CIT’s cutting-edge innovations and engaging student experiences.

Exploring CIT’s Tokyo Campus

Our journey began at CIT’s Toky Campus, where students and faculty gathered for a hands-on introduction to Japan’s leading engineering research. The modern facility, nestled in one of Tokyo’s most vibrant districts, sets the perfect stage for technological exploration and collaboration.

#### Cyber Wheel: Revolutionising Mobility

One of the highlights of the visit was the Cyber Wheel demonstration. CIT researchers showcased this novel, all-terrain personal transporter that reimagines urban mobility. Attendees had the chance to ride the Cyber Wheel themselves, experiencing first-hand how its intuitive balance controls and responsive handling can navigate complex city environments. This session opened discussions on robotics, mechanical engineering, and the future of personal transportation in smart cities.

VR Marathon: Pushing Virtual Boundaries

Next, we moved into the world of immersive virtual reality with CIT’s VR Marathon project. Participants donned VR headsets and took part in a simulated marathon through digital recreations of historic Tokyo landmarks. The experience combined physical activity with advanced VR technologies, illustrating how virtual environments can enhance fitness, training, and entertainment. Students and faculty alike were impressed by the seamless integration of motion tracking, real-time feedback, and expansive virtual landscapes.

Space Technology with NASA

CIT’s collaboration with NASA offers another layer of excitement. During the visit, our students explored the latest space technology co-developed by CIT and NASA, including micro-satellite components and sensor systems designed for low-earth orbit missions. As a creative twist, participants also had the opportunity to design their own virtual fireworks display, learning about propulsion systems and atmospheric conditions in a hands-on workshop that blended aerospace engineering with artistic expression.

Why This Visit Matters

This interactive visit to Chiba Institute of Technology offered more than just a tour. It provided practical insights through robotics and VR demonstrations, inspiration from smart mobility and space technology, and global collaboration by engaging with CIT faculty and researchers.
