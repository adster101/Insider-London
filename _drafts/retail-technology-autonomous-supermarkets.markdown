Major food retailers in the UK have been accelerating their investment and implementation of AI technology in their checkout-free new stores all across the country. They include *Pick and Go* by Sainsbury's, *Shop&Go* by Aldi, *GetGo* by Tesco; and adding to the established high street supermarket chains is the tech giant Amazon with *Amazon Fresh*.

Technology and process is similar in all four stores: 
* Customers need to download the store app to link their payment cards and gain entry to the store, so no browsing is allowed without the app.
* Specially positioned cameras detect which products customers have picked up.
* The smart technology automatically adds anything the customer takes off the shelf to their virtual cart and removes items they put back on the shelf.
* Customers get charged after leaving the store and without them having to scan anything or visit a till. 

Amazon has been trailblazing this tech with [Just Walk Out](https://justwalkout.com/) for some time now in the USA with *Amazon GO* stores. *Amazon Fresh*, which [opened](https://www.shopfloorinsights.co.uk/storecheck-amazon-fresh) last year in Ealing, London as their first physical store outside of the USA (if one discounts the fact that Amazon already owns the Whole Foods Market). Amazon has since then opened further seven stores in London, and has plans to aggressively [expand](https://www.chargedretail.co.uk/2021/11/11/amazon-plans-to-open-200-cashierless-fresh-stores-to-catch-tesco-and-sainsburys/) with 200 new locations of Amazon Fresh stores by 2024 to gain a significant footprint in the UK very competitive market. 

Sainsbury’s has had their own smart app since 2016 for seamless quick shopping called [SmartShop](https://smartshop.sainsburys.co.uk/), however it’s not fully automated as you still need to scan the items yourself, but you save time as there is no need visit the tills. Interestingly, Sanisbury’s has been using Amazon’s very own **Just Walk Out** technology in combination with **SmartShop** at their new initiative [Pick & Go](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2021/11/29/sainsburys-opens-smartshop-pick-and-go-store-at-holborn-circus-london) store since 2019 in Holborn Circus in London. 

Other supermarket chains are trying to catch up as this revolutionary technology is very likely going to change the retail landscape for years to come.  Tesco teamed up with a start-up [Trigo](https://www.trigoretail.com/) for their [GetGo](https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2021/tesco-opens-new-checkout-free-store-getgo/) in High Holborn London last November. And not wanting to be left behind, the discount chain Aldi has teamed up with AI company [AiFi](https://aifi.com/) to develop its first [Shop&Go](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2022/1/18/aifi-tech-powers-new-aldi-uk-checkout-free-concept-store) grocery store in Greenwich, London.  Shop&Go's experience goes a bit further as it also uses tech by a company called [Yoti](https://www.yoti.com/) to confirm customers’ identity on age restricted items such as alcohol using face recognition technology.
