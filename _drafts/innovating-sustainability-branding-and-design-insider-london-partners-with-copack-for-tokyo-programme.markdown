We are thrilled to announce our newest partnership with [COPACK](](https://www.copack.co.jp/en/about/concept?language_settings=OK_INbESlrHVC#), a leading company redefining the world of branding, design, and sustainable packaging solutions. As part of our [Tokyo Programme](https://www.insiderlondon.com/asia/tokyo/), we are offering an exclusive opportunity to explore COPACK’s innovative approach to sustainability and cutting-edge design concepts, giving visitors a first-hand experience of how Japan’s forward-thinking companies are shaping the future of branding and packaging.

#### **Company History and Vision**  
COPACK was founded in 1951 in Tokyo’s Yanagibashi district and began its journey by focusing on the production of packaging materials, particularly cardboard and hangers. Over the decades, the company has continuously adapted to the evolving demands of the consumer market, particularly in the retail and fashion industries. COPACK’s early innovations in hanger recycling began when the current CEO, Kensou Saito, was struck by the large volumes of discarded hangers and committed to developing a recycling initiative. This effort was groundbreaking for the industry and marked the beginning of COPACK’s venture into environmental sustainability.


#### **Sustainability Initiatives**  

COPACK’s commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in its operations. The company has taken significant strides to create a circular economy within its industry, with several standout projects:  

1. **Project e-Pack**: This initiative is dedicated to promoting recycling and sustainability. COPACK produces items using recycled resources and environmentally friendly materials, ensuring that no hangers are wasted.  
2. **Circular Hanger Systems**: COPACK aims to eliminate hanger waste by recovering and reusing every hanger they produce. They also manufacture hangers from FSC-certified wood and recycled materials.  
3. **Innovative Packaging Solutions**: In the packaging domain, COPACK has developed water-repellent paper reinforced with CNF (Cellulose Nanofibers) as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic packaging.  

Through these efforts, COPACK supports sustainable retail operations and helps its clients align with global environmental goals, particularly the **United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The company focuses on themes such as sustainable consumption, preserving marine ecosystems, and protecting terrestrial biodiversity.  
 
### **Design, Branding, and Client Support**  
COPACK’s expertise extends beyond manufacturing. The company provides a full range of services to elevate product presentation, encompassing:  
- **Design and Prototyping**: Tailoring display fixtures and layouts to maximise product appeal.  
- **Holistic Support**: Advising on effective product showcasing and retail strategies, particularly in fashion, cosmetics, food, and miscellaneous goods sectors.  

Their designs are tailored to tell unique brand stories, blending modern aesthetics with deep respect for the environment. This holistic approach sets them apart in a world where branding is often at odds with sustainability.

This all-encompassing approach, from design to delivery, is made possible by the wealth of knowledge and experience COPACK has cultivated over decades.  

#### **Creative Initiatives and Community Engagement**  
COPACK doesn’t just design tools for showcasing products—it also explores new ways to present and conceptualise retail spaces. The [CBK Gallery](https://gallery.copack.co.jp/), an open and collaborative space, exemplifies this mission.  

The gallery hosts various events, including:  
- **Exhibitions**: Featuring not only fashion but also illustrations, food displays, and more, showcasing unique approaches to presentation.  
- **Workshops and Seminars**: Covering topics such as fashion maintenance and display techniques, bringing together specialists and innovators.  


#### **Looking Ahead**  
COPACK remains dedicated to staying at the forefront of innovation and sustainability. By combining cutting-edge design, environmentally conscious materials, and community-oriented initiatives, the company continues to inspire both its clients and the global marketplace. Their adaptability and customer-centric focus ensure that they can meet the evolving needs of their partners while advancing their mission to create a more sustainable world.
