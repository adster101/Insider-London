We are thrilled to announce our newest partnership with COPACK Co., Ltd., a leading company redefining the world of branding, design, and sustainable packaging solutions. As part of our Tokyo Programme, we are offering an exclusive opportunity to explore COPACK’s innovative approach to sustainability and cutting-edge design concepts, giving visitors a first-hand experience of how Japan’s forward-thinking companies are shaping the future of branding and packaging.

#### **Company History and Vision**  
[COPACK](https://www.copack.co.jp/en/about/concept?language_settings=OK_INbESlrHVC#) was founded in **1951** in Tokyo’s Yanagibashi district and began as a producer of hangers and packaging materials, focusing on cardboard. Over the years, the company evolved to meet the diverse needs of a changing consumer market, transitioning from simple product production to becoming a leader in display fixtures and sustainable solutions.  

Founded on the pillars of environmental consciousness and innovative design, COPACK stands out as a pioneer in sustainable packaging and branding solutions. With a commitment to reducing waste while delivering captivating designs, COPACK ensures that its products are not only functional but also eco-friendly. Their ethos is simple yet profound: to create packaging that connects people, products, and the planet.


### **Sustainability Initiatives**  
COPACK’s commitment to sustainability is deeply embedded in its operations. The company has taken significant strides to create a circular economy within its industry, with several standout projects:  

1. **Project e-Pack**: This initiative is dedicated to promoting recycling and sustainability. COPACK produces items using recycled resources and environmentally friendly materials, ensuring that no hangers are wasted.  
2. **Circular Hanger Systems**: COPACK aims to eliminate hanger waste by recovering and reusing every hanger they produce. They also manufacture hangers from FSC-certified wood and recycled materials.  
3. **Innovative Packaging Solutions**: In the packaging domain, COPACK has developed water-repellent paper reinforced with CNF (Cellulose Nanofibers) as an eco-friendly alternative to traditional plastic packaging.  

Through these efforts, COPACK supports sustainable retail operations and helps its clients align with global environmental goals, particularly the **United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. The company focuses on themes such as sustainable consumption, preserving marine ecosystems, and protecting terrestrial biodiversity.

### **Technology and Innovation**  
COPACK leverages technology to streamline operations and enhance customer convenience while prioritizing sustainability. For example, in **2020**, the company established a new production base in the Philippines, equipped with advanced recycling systems.  

Additionally, COPACK has developed a proprietary **online ordering system** designed to reduce energy consumption and paper usage. This platform enables stores to easily order supplies via smartphones, tablets, or computers, eliminating the need for traditional fax or mail-based orders.

### **Design, Branding, and Client Support**  
COPACK’s expertise extends beyond manufacturing. The company provides a full range of services to elevate product presentation, encompassing:  
- **Design and Prototyping**: Tailoring display fixtures and layouts to maximize product appeal.  
- **Holistic Support**: Advising on effective product showcasing and retail strategies, particularly in fashion, cosmetics, food, and miscellaneous goods sectors.  

This all-encompassing approach, from design to delivery, is made possible by the wealth of knowledge and experience COPACK has cultivated over decades.

### **Creative Initiatives and Community Engagement**  
COPACK doesn’t just design tools for showcasing products—it also explores new ways to present and conceptualize retail spaces. The **CBK Gallery**, an open and collaborative space, exemplifies this mission.  

The gallery hosts various events, including:  
- **Exhibitions**: Featuring not only fashion but also illustrations, food displays, and more, showcasing unique approaches to presentation.  
- **Workshops and Seminars**: Covering topics such as fashion maintenance and display techniques, bringing together specialists and innovators.  

In **2019**, the company held a major exhibition, *East Tokyo City*, which celebrated local artists and cultural creativity. The event included collaborations with designers and led to the creation of new brands, such as a line of unique lifestyle goods called "YOLIC."

### **Looking Ahead**  
COPACK remains dedicated to staying at the forefront of innovation and sustainability. By combining cutting-edge design, environmentally conscious materials, and community-oriented initiatives, the company continues to inspire both its clients and the global marketplace. Their adaptability and customer-centric focus ensure that they can meet the evolving needs of their partners while advancing their mission to create a more sustainable world.
