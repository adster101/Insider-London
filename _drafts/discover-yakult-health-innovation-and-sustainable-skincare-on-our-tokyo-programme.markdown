#### Who is Yakult?

Yakult is a Japanese health and wellness company best known for its probiotic drink—a fermented milk beverage that contains the beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus casei Shirota, which helps promote gut health. Founded in 1935, Yakult has grown into a global brand, celebrated not only for its nutritional products but also for its innovative approach to health. Many people might not know that Yakult has also expanded into natural skincare, creating products from bio-ingredients developed through advanced fermentation research. This commitment to combining traditional wellness with modern science and sustainability makes Yakult unique. 

Yakult has a long history of promoting well-being through its scientifically-backed products. The company’s commitment to health extends beyond nutrition; it also innovates in skincare. By using bio ingredients and sustainable practices, Yakult is developing products that not only nourish the skin but also support environmental sustainability. Their forward-thinking approach demonstrates how a company can evolve its product lines to meet modern consumer demands while maintaining its core values.
