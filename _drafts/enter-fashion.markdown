This week we are introducing [Fashion Enter](https://www.fashion-enter.com/), a UK based not-for-profit company which facilitates garment production in its state of the art factory as well as aims to drive ethical and sustainable business practices across the country with its sister company - Fashion Capital.

###The Factory

As the fashion industry operates on very tight margins for each garment manufactured there is fear that sustainability will be neglected in the long run. The more sustainable a company within the sector is, the higher its costs of production will be.
Fashion Enter with its innovative approach has provided each employee with a phone to digitise production.

Meaning that they can track each employee's productivity and the amount of work that has been done in a single day to identify where the inefficiencies occur. 
 
The production factory facilitates garment manufacture for an array of clients for orders of 500 items and above. Their clients include ASOS.com, M & S, Amazon and River Island to name a few. However, there are sometimes exceptions for their order minimum when working with high-end fashion designers. 


The fashion studio facilitates the lowering of barriers of entry to the fashion industry for smaller businesses or individuals looking to enter the sector. The studio is for smaller-scale garment conception and creation helping with pattern sealing, pattern trade etcâ€¦ and has more than 77 customers.
