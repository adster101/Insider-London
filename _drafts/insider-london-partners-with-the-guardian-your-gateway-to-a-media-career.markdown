Founded in 1821, The Guardian has a long and storied history as a bastion of independent journalism. Originally known as The Manchester Guardian, it began as a weekly publication advocating for political reform. Over the decades, The Guardian has evolved into a global news outlet, renowned for its fearless investigative journalism, in-depth analysis, and commitment to social justice. Today, it stands as a pillar of the free press, offering a diverse range of news, opinion pieces, and multimedia content to millions of readers worldwide.

They had the unique opportunity to meet the media professional and gain firsthand insights into the operations of a major news outlet. The students got an insider’s view of The Guardian’s newsroom, witnessed the hustle and bustle of news production, and saw how stories are crafted from inception to publication. By engaging with the speaker and asking questions, they built connections that could be pivotal for their future careers. This experience was designed to give them a taste of the real-world challenges and rewards of working in media.
