#### The Bank of Japan: A Pillar of Stability

As the central bank of Japan, the [BoJ](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/) plays a vital role in ensuring the stability and growth of the Japanese economy. Its monetary control measures are aimed at achieving price stability, which is fundamental for the sound development of the national economy. The BoJ expertly manages interest rates, controls the money supply, and oversees the country's financial system.

Despite the unprecedented challenges posed by the global economy in the last four years, Japan and the BoJ have remained resilient. The BoJ promptly responded with its enhanced US dollar operations, ensuring the availability of foreign currency to support the economy during these challenging times. Additionally, the BoJ maintained monetary easing, and its key interest rate remained at minus 0.1%, providing much-needed support to the economy. The BoJ's confidence in its measures is a testament to its unwavering commitment to the Japanese economy.

#### Tokyo Stock Exchange: Driving Economic Growth

[The Tokyo Stock Exchange](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/) (TSE) is an indispensable platform that enables companies to raise capital and investors to trade securities. It plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth by providing companies with access to capital, facilitating investment opportunities, and fostering innovation. The TSE's contribution to economic recovery is unparalleled, as it instils confidence in corporate earnings growth and offers attractive valuations for the Japanese stock market.

The TSE has urged companies to focus on achieving sustainable growth and enhancing corporate value, particularly those with a price-to-book ratio of less than one. By encouraging companies to invest in research and development (R&D) and human capital, the TSE aims to create intellectual property and intangible assets that contribute to sustainable growth. The TSE's strategic initiative to promote sustainable growth and corporate value is the need of the hour and will undoubtedly benefit the Japanese economy in the long run.
