#### The Bank of Japan: A Pillar of Stability

As the central bank of Japan, the [BoJ](https://www.boj.or.jp/en/) plays a crucial role in ensuring the stability and growth of the Japanese economy. Through its monetary control measures, the BoJ aims to achieve price stability, which is fundamental for the sound development of the national economy. This includes managing interest rates, controlling the money supply, and overseeing the nation's financial system.

The last four years posed unprecedented challenges to the global economy, and Japan was no exception. The BoJ responded swiftly by providing ample U.S. dollars through enhanced U.S. dollar operations, ensuring the availability of foreign currency to support the economy during these challenging times. Furthermore, the BoJ maintained monetary easing and kept its key interest rate at minus 0.1%, providing much-needed support to the economy.

#### Tokyo Stock Exchange: Driving Economic Growth

[The Tokyo Stock Exchange](https://www.jpx.co.jp/english/) (TSE) serves as a critical platform for companies to raise capital and investors to trade securities. The TSE plays a pivotal role in driving economic growth by providing companies with access to capital, facilitating investment, and fostering innovation. The TSE's role in economic recovery cannot be overstated, as it instils confidence in corporate earnings growth and provides attractive valuations for the Japanese stock market as a whole.

The TSE has called on companies to focus on achieving sustainable growth and enhancing corporate value. This strategic imperative is particularly relevant for companies with a price-to-book ratio of below one. By encouraging companies to invest in research and development (R&D) and human capital, the TSE aims to create intellectual property and intangible assets that contribute to sustainable growth.
