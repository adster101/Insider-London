#### Immersing in Local Stories and Traditions

The **Chinese Table** experience invites students to dine with locals, listen to their stories, and savour traditional meals. By engaging in meaningful conversations and sharing meals, students gain valuable insights into the customs, traditions, and daily life of Shanghai residents. These interactions go beyond surface-level encounters, providing a deeper understanding of Chinese culture and fostering connections that transcend cultural boundaries.
