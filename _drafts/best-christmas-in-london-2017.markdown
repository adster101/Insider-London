It’s one of London’s best loved food markets and it’s just one of the markets in London getting itself ready for the festivities. Having just announced it’s extended opening hours for Christmas it won’t be long before it turns December and the historic arches that [Borough](http://boroughmarket.org.uk) is known for will be decked out with stunning decorations. What’s more, traders stalls will be full of seasonal produce for you to buy. You’ll find Christmas treats from all around the world. This will of course include mulled English cider, gingerbread and nutmeg jam. Cheese lovers also listen up. There’s a special event for you over the holidays. Borough Markets [Evening of Cheese ](http://boroughmarket.org.uk/events/evening-of-cheese)will take place on 14 December, where you’ll be able to savour and purchase some incredible cheeses- perfect for that cheese board you’ll be serving up on Christmas Day.

**Southbank Markets**\
Christmas has once again returned to the [Southbank](http://www.southbankcentre.co.uk/whatson/winter-market-1002058). Dotted along the River Thames will be an array of quaint, wooden chalets, each filled with vendors selling trinkets and food stuffs to get you in the spirit of Christmas. You’ll find festive foods, mulled wines and homemade crafts on offer. Enjoy the magical views of Big Ben and the London Eye whilst wandering along the riverbank accompanied by fairy lights and Christmas cheer.
