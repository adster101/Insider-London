Recently we had the great opportunity to host a company visit with [Formula Media](https://www.formulamedia.com/),  a new media advertising and buying agency backed by a wealth of experience. The session was led by Formula Media’s CEO and Founder, [Manish Mak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/makformula/), for the social media master class students from Bayswater College.


Mak began with a story of the fascinating journey he has had in marketing; from working for different agencies and being involved in campaigns for major brands including Bose (wireless headphones), Shell (kinetic energy football pitch) and Sony (reactive campaign). Mak went on to illustrate how the growth of digital and social media in the few years has changed the landscape of marketing and how revolutionary it has been. The shift from offline to online has been accelerating, with online advertising surpassing £259 billion in expenditure as of 2020. The presentation had insightful details of the increase in streaming trends since the pandemic, especially podcasts and gaming, which added other channels for marketers to reach the audience. Mak also pointed out challenges for the agencies as more online content is being published than our ability to consume.

The second part of the session was about discussing the future of digital and social marketing with the students, which led Mak to tell us more about the business model of Formula Media and how they specialise in new and emerging media to disrupt the traditional model. He emphasised that brand awareness has never been more important in the current marketing environment, and how Formula Media has tapped into that with Audience Driven Advertising. Mak also elaborated on great possibilities with the 'democratisation' of marketing into the future and how 'two-way marketing' will change the whole industry. 

It was engaging to hear from him about the successful campaigns Formula Media run for the [Prince’s Trust](https://www.princes-trust.org.uk/) and [Anker(eufy)](https://uk.eufy.com/?ref=logo), to name a few. We ended the visit with an array of questions to Mak about the technology from VR, and AR to voice recognition, and how it’s changing the nature of both advertising and marketing.
