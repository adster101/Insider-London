The marketing and creative industries are undergoing a seismic shift, driven by the rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. From automating content creation to enhancing data analytics, AI is redefining how agencies operate and deliver value to clients. 

#### Embracing the Future of AI in Marketing

The creative and marketing landscape is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by advances in AI, changing consumer expectations, and new ways of working. AI tools are making high-quality content creation more [accessible](https://www.thedrum.com/news/2024/05/12/how-ai-democratizing-creativity) than ever, allowing smaller teams and individual creatives to produce work that once required large budgets and specialist skills. At the same time, data-driven [storytelling](https://www.adweek.com/marketing/data-driven-storytelling-future) is on the rise, with agencies using real-time consumer insights to personalise campaigns and optimise performance continuously.

Across the wider industry, similar innovations are redefining agency workflows. WPP has integrated AI into its global operations through its WPP Open platform and partnerships with major players like [Stability AI](https://stability.ai/), leveraging machine learning to generate content and analyse data more effectively. Meanwhile, [Arcads](https://www.arcads.ai/) is making it possible for marketers to create entire video campaigns with just a prompt, reducing barriers to high-quality production. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/buzz/), with its launch of Buzz, is bringing collaborative AI into the marketing toolchainâ€”helping teams co-create brand-consistent assets more efficiently. Together, these examples illustrate a powerful trend: AI is no longer a future considerationâ€”itâ€™s an active force shaping how creative agencies operate, ideate, and deliver results.

#### Topham Guerin and the AI Frontier in Creative Agencies

[Topham Guerin](https://www.tophamguerin.com/) is a creative agency that stands out with its use of AI to shake things up in the creative industry. In the **2024 Queensland state election**, TGâ€™s digital team played a major role in the Liberal National Party of Queensland's campaign, using artificial intelligence to drive content creation, research, and performance tracking.

TGâ€™s reporting highlighted that its dedicated AI team produced **744 unique ad creatives**, including **465 video ads**, for the campaign. About **half of the videos were AI-generated or edited**, enabling hyper-local, real-time message testing in marginal electorates.

TG didnâ€™t just use AI to make videosâ€”it also built a **full-stack AI campaign workflow**:

* **Synthetic-population research**: TGâ€™s data scientists used AI to simulate entire electorates. These *synthetic populations* were used to test policies and campaign messages in a risk-free environment. The spin-off firm [Electric Twin](https://www.electrictwin.com/) specialises in this approach.
* **Social media analysis**: AI tools scanned social conversations at scale, surfacing trends, voter sentiment, and potential hot-button issues across platforms.
* **Media tracking and reporting**: Automated AI dashboards tracked campaign performance in real time, from ad spend to impressions to engagement.
* **Creative production**: The AI team rapidly generated visuals, voiceovers, and video assets, enabling TG to scale production far beyond traditional campaign methods.

#### Other Uses of AI in TGâ€™s Creative Work

Outside of politics, TG has continued experimenting with generative AI. In 2022, they began using AI-generated images in digital marketing campaigns, claiming up to **2Ã— performance improvement** over traditional stock visuals.

More recently, TG produced what they believe to be **Australiaâ€™s first fully AI-generated political TV ad** for the ACT Liberal Partyâ€”scripted, voiced, and rendered entirely with generative AI tools. The campaign saved significantly on production costs while maintaining visual impact.

Other practical AI applications at TG include:

* On-demand voiceover generation
* Bespoke visual creation for brand campaigns
* Automated media planning and performance tracking

TGâ€™s AI team is not an add-on; itâ€™s embedded in every stage of modern creative campaigningâ€”from research and message testing to execution and reporting.
