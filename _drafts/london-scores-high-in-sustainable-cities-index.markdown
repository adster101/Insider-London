#### Sustainable Cities Index

Trying to define what makes a city sustainable is a complex matter. Some cities offer plenty of green space but have poor public transport networks, others have extensive recycling programmes but too few cycling lanes. 

[Arcadis](https://www.arcadis.com/) – a global design, engineering and management consulting company – has, since 2015, been refining an index of its own. The Arcadis Sustainable Cities Index 2022 measures 100 cities according to 51 metrics across 26 themes, arrayed under the three pillars of sustainability: Planet (environmental), People (social), and Profit (economic). The Planet pillar aims to capture environmental factors like energy usage and emissions, the People pillar measures social performance, including quality of life, and the Profit pillar assesses each city’s business environment.

Arcadis’s report takes a holistic view of sustainability in a bid to emphasise the evolving challenges facing cities, including the climate emergency, and the cost-of-living crisis together with long-term challenges associated with the quality and availability of healthcare and education.

#### Sustainable Cities Matter 

More than half of the global population lives in a city and, by 2050, the urban proportion is expected to reach two-thirds. 
While covering only 2% of the earth’s surface, cities consume 78% of the world’s energy. Moreover, they produce more than 60% of greenhouse gas emissions. Yet cities are also “fuelling some of our greatest challenges”, said the Arcadis report.

The sheer density of people relying on fossil fuels makes urban populations highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Fewer green spaces exacerbate the problem. According to the IPCC report, limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would “require rapid and far-reaching transitions in uses of energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems.”

An added challenge is the projection, in a UN [report](https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/2018-revision-of-world-urbanization-prospects.html), that another 2.5 billion people will reside in urban areas by 2050; nearly 90 per cent of them in cities in Asia and Africa. The good news is that cities around the world have already begun to take measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and are putting policies in place that encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Efforts by policymakers and administrators to address climate change, however, will need to accelerate to keep pace with population growth and rapid climate change.


#### London Score

London came 6th in the ranking in the report, London is an all-rounder, scoring well on all three pillars, with particular strength in Planet. Out of the three pillars, its lowest rank is in Profit, where it still ranks a very healthy 23rd. London has particular strengths around the quality of its transport infrastructure and (to a slightly lesser extent) the sustainability of that transport infrastructure. It has an above-average share of new EVs being registered there, but the quality of its EV charging infrastructure is average, suggesting this may be an area for future investment. London's share of renewables within the energy mix is relatively high (but not exceptional), so while the city is undoubtedly ahead of the curve, it still needs to invest in its energy transition.

Suitability vs Prosperity 

As cities race to tackle climate change, and battle the cost-of-living crisis, now is the time to redefine what prosperous and sustainable cities look like, to ensure the best quality of life for all.
“Often, cities have a laser focus on attracting businesses, investors and skills to feed the Profit pillar,” Hogg says. “There should be as much fanfare when it comes to creating affordable housing, building net-zero infrastructure and transport, and reducing air pollution.” - Peter Hogg, Arcadis’s UK Cities Director
