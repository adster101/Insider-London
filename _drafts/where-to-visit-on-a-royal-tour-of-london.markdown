Not much time has passed since [29 million people] (https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2018/05/21/royal-wedding-ratings-how-many-people-watched-prince-harry-wed-meghan-markle/) worldwide tuned in to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle tie the knot in one of the most popular royal weddings of all time. But if you can’t let go of royal wedding fever, why not enjoy a [guided tour] (https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/historical-walking-tours/) of London and see some of the most important sights in British regal history?

**Windsor**

While not strictly in London, this picturesque town is situated on the River Thames just west of the capital. Most people now associate it as the location of last weekend’s nuptials, and according to Direct Line for Business, 850,000 people travelled to Windsor to soak up the atmosphere and catch a glimpse of the newlyweds on their horse-drawn carriage.

However, [Windsor Castle] (https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/windsorcastle) has been an important site for the Royal family for centuries, and the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh spend several months of the year residing at the 11th Century building.

Visitors can take public tours of the State Apartments, where they can see beautiful paintings and luxurious furnishings and interiors. 

**Buckingham Palace**

No royal tour of London would be complete without a stop at [Buckingham Palace] (https://tickets.royalcollection.org.uk/state-rooms-buckingham-palace/state-rooms/2018?_ga=2.11234804.1149715566.1527167212-502372098.1527167212), and those who have never seen the magnificent building before will certainly recognise it, as it is the site for many public engagements. 

This working palace is the Queen’s official London residence, but visitors are allowed in the doors to get a closer look at the breath-taking structure between July and September. Open to the public are 19 State Rooms that are used for official ceremonies and entertaining.

**The Royal Mews**

Those who are not heading to London at the right time to see the State Rooms can still enjoy a royal experience by visiting the [Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace] (https://tickets.royalcollection.org.uk/?f%5B0%5D=im_field_customer_type%3A6&f%5B1%5D=im_field_attraction%3A45&_ga=2.177258981.1149715566.1527167212-502372098.1527167212). This is the stables for the royal family’s horses and where the historic carriages and coaches are kept. Visitors can head here between February and November each year.
