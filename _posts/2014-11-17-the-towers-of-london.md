**Name:** White Tower (Tower of London)

**Date:** Est. 1100

**Architect:** Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester – under instruction from William the Conqueror

**Fan:** Military historian Allen Brown described the tower as “the donjon _par excellence”,_ noting its “strength, majesty and lordly accommodation”.

**Critic:** We can safely assume that Ranulf Flambard and Charles, Duke of Orléans would be amongst the critics of the tower, having both been held prisoner there.
