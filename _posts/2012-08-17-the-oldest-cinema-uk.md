    It seems a shame in London to grace the static lint-laden carpets of Cineworlds and the likes when there are so many amazing old picture houses; particularly, The Phoenix in East Finchley. I’ve heard, if you are a bit more Southerly inclined, there is an equally charming little cinema in Clapham.

    When you enter The Phoenix, it’s status as “the oldest cinemas in the UK” is not a surprise. One is immediately transported back; with the quaint popcorn vendor and posters of whichever cult film they are screening that month.

    As it is an independent business, it is a wonder that it has survived for more than a century and myriad economic crises. Or is it?

    Although it is more expensive, it is much more appealing. Maybe it is because of the worlds new-found love for all things “vintage”. Possibly this began with the appeal of not spending more money or making unnecessary things; both seem to make sense given the financial clime. However, in both cases: the more years, the more money.

    Luckily, it has grabbed the attention of the well-off art-house scenesters. Picture houses are cool. No self-respecting film critic would be seen dead in a multiplex. Mark Kermode recently talked about his <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/may/27/radio-review-kermode-and-mayo-film-review" target="_blank">loyalty to The Phoenix</a> and the importance of supporting art house cinemas. He reasoned that the smaller cinemas screen more interesting films, and we will miss them when they are gone &#8211; like charming local groceries being bankrupt by supermarkets.

    Whether it is due to the love of all things old, the superior film selections, or just plain kookiness; I think we all hope The Phoenix can bear witness to the next 100 years of film history.
