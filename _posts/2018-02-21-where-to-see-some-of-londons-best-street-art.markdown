London is well-known for its wide range of art galleries, many of which are free to visit, not to mention its thriving arts scene. But not all of the capital’s art can be found hanging in galleries - there’s plenty to see on the streets too, if you know where to look.

If you don’t have the time or inclination to go on hunt for street art yourself, joining our [street art tour in London](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/street-art/) could be the way to go. 

We’ll take you to see gems by the likes of Banksy (one of his earliest works, in fact) and Belgian graffiti artist ROA, as well as many more murals and scenes created by artists such as Stik, D*Face and Invader, among others. 

Our tour lasts about two hours and starts in Shoreditch, which is a great place to discover alternative culture in London, art and otherwise.

We might need to add some new stops on our tour in the future though, after the Mayor of London awarded £5,000 in funding to a group of local street artists to create a legal wall art gallery in Walthamstow. 

The [East London and West Essex Guardian](http://www.guardian-series.co.uk/news/15914200.Artists___39_delighted__39__after_Mayor_of_London_gives_them___5k_to_create_legal_street_art_garden/) reported on the Leytonstone Art Gardens project, which will incorporate walls where graffiti artists can legally express themselves and share their work with the local community. 

Another place you may want to head to see some gigantic street art is at an area of industrial land in East London, where [Zippo and street artist Ben Eine](http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/zippo-and-street-artist-ben-eine-create-17500-square-meter-mural-in-east-london-669879373.html) created a 17,500sq/m mural on a disused piece of ground. It’s so huge it can only be seen fully from the air - the team used drone footage while they worked to check their progress.
