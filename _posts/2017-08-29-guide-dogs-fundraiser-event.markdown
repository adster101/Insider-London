This month we've been trying to raise as much money as possible for the [Guide Dogs for the Blind Association ](http://www.guidedogs.org.uk/)in order to raise at least £700 for them. And with your help we've done just that. Over two weekends, five tours, and with forty guests, we have raised a staggering £800 for the charity.

Richard, one of the Insider London tour guides, found the fundraising experience an enjoyable one, 'It’s great to see how our guests enjoy our tours! To know, that every penny they paid goes to a good cause – Guide Dogs’ services and their great campaigns – makes it even more rewarding'.

And it wasn't just the tour guides who enjoyed themselves, each one of our guests had a great time on the tours, whether they were exploring the underground on our Tube Tour, or learning about the dark side of the city in our Death and Debauchery Tour. Oliver Hawkes, who participated in our tube tour said, 'Even though I'm a Londoner, I learned so much today. I walk past many of these places every day, but there were so many things I hadn't noticed until Jonas had pointed them out today. It was a fascinating and great experience'. 

After such a great few weekends Insider London is looking forward to holding more fundraisers in the future, Jonas, an Insider London tour guide and organiser of this event wants to say 'thanks to all our great guests, we were able to hit our target and deliver five great tours. Many people gave more than what we asked for to join the tours, and everyone was so supportive - it was a great event for us'.
