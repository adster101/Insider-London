Plans for the weekend yet? Well, aside from going on one of <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/" target="_blank">our excellent London walking tours</a>, you could check out the results of [Books About Town](http://www.booksabouttown.org.uk/) project.

We wrote about [Books About Town](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2013/12/10/london-benches-books/) back in December, a project to turn install book-shaped benches throughout London. The benches launched earlier this week, with 50 different designs by artists and writers to be discovered all around the capital. The books all have a link to London, from Mary Poppins to Bridget Jones, Peter Pan to Mrs Dalloway, meaning there should be a bench for most literary persuasions.

There are [four different trails](http://www.booksabouttown.org.uk/?action=ListTrails) you can follow around the city to discover the books: Bloomsbury, the City, Riverside and Greenwich &#8211; where all these benches were spotted.

All the benches will be auctioned on the 7 October, with profits going to the National Literary Trust.
