Here at Insider London we are pleased to announce that our competition to win a Ben Slow x Antique collaboration t-shirt has successfully ended. We have randomly selected a winner, and the limited edition t-shirt has now been dispatched.

If you were unsuccessful in the competition or were too late to enter, then all is not lost. You can still check out our interview with the guys behind Antique Clothing by [clicking here](/antique-x-ben-slow-collaboration/). We talk street art, their unique business model and the reasons behind their exciting collaboration.

Keep your eyes on the Insider London blog for more news on street art and London Underground, more interviews, and more chances to win a prize!
