We're excited to announce: In just four weeks, we'll be raising funds for Age UK!

The days are getting shorter and colder - Christmas is coming. Soon, we get together with friends and family, and do things we love together. At Insider London, we are all about exploring this great city of ours, and we love to share this passion with you. That's why we invite all of you to gather on December 2nd and 3rd and explore with us, all while supporting charity. How?

Every penny paid for the specially selected tours that weekend will go to Age UK. Age UK works to make this country a great place to grow older – for all of us. They campaign for older people's rights, provide advice, and offer services on many issues such as health and loneliness. We believe in their values just as much as we believe that walking tours are a great way to get together and explore a city in a healthy and fun way, whatever your age. So join us to support them.

We want to raise at least £700 this December. If you join any of these five tour dates (by sending an email to [jonas@insider-london.co.uk](mailto:jonas@insider-london.co.uk)), everything you pay will go towards this goal:

Saturday, 2 Dec
* The London Underground & Tube Tour at 2pm
* The Death & Debauchery Tour at 5pm
* The History of Drinking & Pubs Tour at 7pm

Sunday, 3 Dec
* The Quirky London Tour at 11am
* The East End Crime Tour at 5pm

Join us and support a great cause – we'd love to see you there! If you are interested in booking or have any questions, please get in touch with Jonas at [jonas@insider-london.co.uk](mailto:jonas@insider-london.co.uk).
