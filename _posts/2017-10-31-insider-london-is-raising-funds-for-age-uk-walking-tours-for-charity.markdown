We're excited to announce: In just four weeks, we'll be running special tours to raise funds for Age UK!

The days are getting shorter and colder - Christmas is coming. Soon, we'll get together with friends and family, and do things we love together. At Insider London, we are all about exploring this great city of ours, and we love to share this passion with you. That's why we invite all of you to gather on **December 2nd and 3rd** and explore with us, all while supporting Age UK.

### Who is Age UK

Age UK works to make this country a great place to grow older – for all of us. They campaign for older people's rights, provide advice, and offer services on many issues such as health and loneliness. We believe in their values just as much as we believe that walking tours are a great way to get together and explore a city in a healthy and fun way, whatever your age. So join us to support them.

### Our support

We want to raise at least £700 this December. To do so, we've set up five specially selected tours. Every penny paid for these will go to Age UK.
