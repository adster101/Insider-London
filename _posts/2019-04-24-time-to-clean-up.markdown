It is virtually impossible to ignore environmental issues in this day and age.  This week we have had a series of demonstrations in London under the banner of [‘Extinction Rebellion’](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-47959207) and surely things have gone far enough when Richard Madeley pointed out that [David Attenborough is not a saint.](https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/disrespectful-richard-madeley-sparks-outrage-as-he-denies-sir-david-attenborough-saint-status-a4118836.html)

 

Climate change is now accepted by the vast majority of leading scientists made clear on 12 December 2015 (after 21 years of negotiations) when the UN delivered a universal, legally binding climate change deal.  The Paris Agreement aims to keep warming “well below” 2C above pre-industrial temperatures, while striving to limit increases to 1.5C. 

 

Increasingly entrepreneurs are considering new ways that technology can be used to improve the environment and promote sustainability in society.  Just as the financial world is having to accept disruptive ideas usually referred to as fintech, technology start-ups in the area of environmentalism use the term cleantech.  Clean technology is largely centred around the following key areas; sustainable energy and reducing our dependency on fossil fuels, the provision of clean water to all who need it, pollution reduction, recycling and waste management. 


 

This is no longer a niche area evidenced by the involvement of companies of the size and stature of [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/).  On their website they say the following: 

 

“As clean technologies come down the cost curve, they become increasingly disruptive to traditional business models. We help clients understand how advances in clean technologies affect industry structure and competitive dynamics. Recently we assisted an oil company in investigating how rapid improvements in the economics of electric vehicles could reshape the demand for gasoline.” 

 

As with more areas of innovative business the truth of success will be found by following the money.  The research teams at Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) report that "Renewable energy sources are set to represent almost three-quarters of the $10.2 trillion the world will invest in new power generating technology until 2040." 

 

At Insider London we have appreciated for several years the growing interest in green technology and sustainability.  [Our Cutting Edge Green Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/cutting-edge-green-tour/) involves a walk through the centre of London that explores how London is confronting sustainability, whether it’s public transport, green hotels or major building projects.  We are also delighted to now be able to offer a [Business Visit](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/in-depth-business-visits/) to an exciting start-up, [Desolenator](https://desolenator.com/).  Their aim is to raise the profile of the water crisis globally and they have developed a technology that “turns undrinkable water sources drinkable”.

We would be delighted to organise a walk for your group and/or introduce you to a cutting edge cleantech company that is based in the London hub of start-ups in the Silicon Roundabout area.
