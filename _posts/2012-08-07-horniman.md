<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: 13px;font-weight: normal"><a href="http://www.horniman.ac.uk/">The Horniman Museum</a> is a mysterious place.  </span>

<div>
  <p>
    I remember dawdling in one of its dingy stairwells before a Saturday course for the under tens (we were going to paint insects onto stones and then varnish them) when suddenly an enormous grinning badger bounded up the stairs towards me.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    In fact the badger was about 80 years old and was closely followed by what was probably a keen apprentice taxidermist taking it for a weekend spruce up and a re-stuff. But in that split second, I was in Narnia.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A faun might not meet and greet you, but the Horniman is still an enchanted land: a <a href="http://www.horniman.ac.uk/collections/unmasking-the-mysterious-merman/">merman </a>is one of its most prized exhibits, and the Centenary Gallery is stocked full of ritualistic paraphernalia, tribal costumes, South American carnival masks and ancestral figures from Papua New Guinea.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    What makes the museum so special is the scope of its collection, which includes major galleries dedicated to natural history together with a vast array of musical instruments and an anthropology section. Despite the modernised building, interactive displays and &#8216;handling collection&#8217;, it retains plenty of the original battiness of the place. A haphazard display of birds in bell jars, metal helmets from Iran and &#8216;reliefs in Alhambra style&#8217; (below) are preserved from the heyday of the eclectic Victorian curiosity cabinet.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Or if pickled nervous systems are more your thing, make sure you browse the deepest darkest corners of the natural history gallery. Have a look at the families of Welsh polecats and Cumberland otters, trace the evolution of the elephant through a series of massive skulls, and check out the insects and arachnids upstairs.

    But what&#8217;s all this about a walrus?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Horniman walrus is the quirky centrepiece of the quirky natural history gallery. It is one of the museum&#8217;s original exhibits. But the Victorian taxidermists who mounted it in 1870 had never even seen a picture of a real walrus, let alone the real thing, so didn&#8217;t know that they are famously wrinkly with huge folds of flesh.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    They just kept on stuffing.
  </p>

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today the bloated, completely un-lifelike walrus is one of the museum&#8217;s most popular exhibits.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So, heading to the Horniman for the first time? The honey-coloured building is unmissable with its iconic totem pole towering at the top of the hill, ten minutes from Forest Hill station. It is surrounded by whimsical gardens (home to a healthy contingent of South London&#8217;s parakeets) with some spectacular views over the city. And there&#8217;s a prettily ornate conservatory where you can bring a picnic or get a reasonably priced cuppa from the café – another perk of the suburban museum.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just remember: never run with badgers.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The Horniman is a ten minute walk from Forest Hill station, now on the London Overground line. Open daily 10.30am &#8211; 5.30pm.

    <em><strong>While you&#8217;re in the area</strong></em>, on the way back to Forest Hill Station, make sure you poke your nose in <a href="http://www.jdwetherspoon.co.uk/home/pubs/the-capitol-forest-hill">The Capitol</a> – an elegant 1920&#8217;s cinema turned Wetherspoon&#8217;s pub.
