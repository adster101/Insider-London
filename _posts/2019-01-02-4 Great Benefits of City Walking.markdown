## It's an easy way to trim down after Christmas trimmings!  

 

The physical health benefits of walking are numerous. One recent study found a strong link between those who walk in cities and those with lower blood pressure, as well as a reduced risk of hypertension – associated in particular with [cardiovascular diseases](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/feb/05/walkable-cities-reduce-blood-pressure-study-finds).Walking at a relatively brisk pace of about [4 miles an hour for 30 minutes can burn 150 calories](https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/health/benefits-of-walking-a3807861.html) so come and walk off those festive indulgences. 

 

## It's a proven way to relax  

 

It's no secret that exercise releases endorphins but even from regular gentle walking then we can reap the benefits. Countless studies show the benefits of walking for mental health in a variety of ways; from stress reduction to mood improvement. Many sources even say that [regular walkers experience less fatigue](https://www.walkingforhealth.org.uk/get-walking/why-walk/healthy-minds). 

 

## It helps reduce pollution 

 

2018 was the year of the air pollution scandal, so let's make 2019 the year to do something about it. Reduce your carbon footprint by moving the soles of your feet. Less vehicles on our roads mean cleaner air for all so leave the car at home and enjoy London's increasingly-green public space. Go and explore exciting redevelopment projects like Kings Cross, which place [pedestrianisation at their core](https://www.kingscross.co.uk/construction/2018/11/15/pedestrianisation-of-granary-square).
