We are now rounding off our busiest summer yet at Insider London and would like to warmly thank all our partners, both new and returning. We thank you for putting your faith in us to deliver the best programmes for your groups.

Here at Insider London we believe that for true business and industry insight then we must look beyond the walls of the classroom. With In-Depth Business Visits, students meet real company personnel and learn from them first-hand. Our programmes get students out exploring practical examples of business trends and tracing the development of business eco-systems with their own eyes.

We are deeply passionate about best practice sharing across industries and across borders. We feel that in a globalised, interconnected world then we can all learn from one another. With the rate of change exponentially increasing then we keep a close eye on the latest trends in the start-up world and invite big business to join us. For each group, we recommend a bespoke range of visits based on their objectives and requirements. We are excited to facilitate these learning interactions between adjacent sectors or international counterparts.

A huge thank you to our educational groups, corporate groups and corporate partners for such a fantastic summer. We look forward to the many exciting sessions to come.

We were so happy to welcome such engaged student groups this year including Chinese students from CL Global and CUDC, American students from Baylor University, Boston University, Spelman College and Texas Christian University and South African students from Wits Business School. A highlight of our summer is meeting each new summer school group from LSE, King’s College, UCL, Imperial, Sheffield and SOAS. Finally, we can’t forget our great activities with independent education providers: Oxford International, Malvern House, CIEE and IES.
