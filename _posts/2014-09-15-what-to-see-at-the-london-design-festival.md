The <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/" target="_blank">London Design Festival</a> kicked off at the weekend, showcasing the capital&#8217;s creativity. There are hundreds of events going on, from talks to trade shows and we&#8217;ve waded through the listings so you don&#8217;t have to. Here&#8217;s what we recommend checking out.

**<a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/va-museum" target="_blank">The V&A</a>**

</p>

If you really don&#8217;t know where to start, head to the V&A Museum. It&#8217;s one of the festival&#8217;s main hubs and they&#8217;ve got a full calendar of exhibitions, installations and talks so you&#8217;re bound to find something you fancy. The headline grabbers are probably architect Zaha Hadid&#8217;s <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/events/crest-zaha-hadid" target="_blank">Crest</a> installed in the Museum&#8217;s garden, and Barber & Osgerby&#8217;s <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/events/double-space-bmw-precision-poetry-motion" target="_blank">Double Space</a> installed in the stunning Raphael Gallery (pictured).  Two moving mirrors give you the chance to look at the Raphael Cartoons in a whole new way.

It&#8217;s not just the pigeons who will be at home in Trafalgar Square this London Design Festival. Four designers &#8211; Jasper Morrison, Patternity, Raw Edges and Studioilse &#8211; have been asked to explore what it is that makes a house become a home. The results will be on display in the Square from the 18th to the 22nd September. We&#8217;re especially in interesting in taking a peek inside Raw Edges interpretation: a design that promises to show how &#8220;with limited space and an imaginative approach, it’s possible to make the most of even the smallest living area within a densely populated city.&#8221;

Similar ideas are being explored in the WikiHouse on display in Bloomsbury. The house claims to be the world&#8217;s first open source, digitally-printed house  and something &#8220;anyone can download, adapt, ‘print’ and assemble in a few days, with no construction skills, and for less than £50k.&#8221; Well, <a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/inside-the-flatpack-home-billed-as-the-answer-to-londons-housing-crisis-9725665.html" target="_blank">according to the <em>Evening Standard</em></a>, this house took twenty volunteers eight days to put the house together but it&#8217;s still being discussed as a possible answer to London&#8217;s housing crisis. Also worth checking out is an event this Thursday 18 called &#8220;<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/innovation-in-the-future-of-housing-tickets-12969182173" target="_blank">Innovation in the Future of Housing</a>&#8220;, including those involved in the conception and construction of the WikiHouse.

</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Over in Haggerston, Dan Tobin Smith explores Kipple. &#8220;Kipple&#8221; is a term invented by the writer Phillip K. Dick to describe the useless objects and detritus that accumulate and surround us during our lifetime. These objects, from obsolete keyboards to used plastic packaging, have been arranged in a huge colour spectrum. Visitors can pick their way through the swathe of objects, many donated by members of the public. There&#8217;s <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/news/first-law-kipple-supper-club" target="_blank">also a supperclub</a> that will take place in the midst of the kipple.

</p>

Ever looked enviously upon New York&#8217;s High Line? Us too. Camden gets its own version this LDF &#8211; well, kind of. Artists are taking over Camden&#8217;s rooftops to create works viewed by the public from street level. Romain Meunier and Tsvetelina Tomova are creating &#8220;The Rooftop Line&#8221;, a model train complete with a live webcam that will convey images of life up on the high line, while trio Benedict Goodwin, Serena Montesissa and Francesco Gorni are creating a green billboard that will grow and change over the course of the festival.
