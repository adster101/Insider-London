With the Easter weekend looming and May just around the corner then it's time to take advantage of all the exciting opportunities London has to offer. From cats to comedy, read on for our top ten fun events to attend during the upcoming bank holidays. 

 

 

This Saturday (20th April), head on down to Trafalgar Square to celebrate all things British! Organised by City Hall, the “Feast of St George” (https://www.london.gov.uk/events/2019-04-20/feast-st-george-2019 ) is completely free, with no pre-booking required. This one-stop festival boasts an artisan craft market, a street food fair, comedy tent and main stage jam-packed with lively performances from contemporary choirs to folk and jazz.  

 

Further along the Strand at the beautiful Somerset House you can find the Sony World Photography Awards (https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/2019-sony-world-photography-awards-exhibition). Showing from 18th April until the 6th May this highly-praised exhibition showcases the best of an open entry call which saw a record-breaking 327,000 photos submitted. This is the world's largest photo competition, split into four streams: Professional, Youth, Student and Overrall open.  

 

 Love cats? Then you will love this May bank holiday special at the International Cat Expo (https://londoncats.org.uk/ ). At least two thousand cats and a few thousand cat enthusiasts are set to pile into Tobacco Docks to celebrate all things feline. From 4-5th May, expect a huge variety of cat accessories on sale, a potentially-bizarre cat agility competition, and even an A-list cat celebrity or two...

Alternately, for some genuine sport (no offence to the jumping cats), then get your ticket to the women's FA Championship at Wembley Stadium (http://www.thefa.com/news/2019/feb/28/womens-fa-cup-final-tickets-280219 ). Kicking off on May Bank Holiday weekend (Saturday 4th). Will Chelsea keep the top spot? There's only one way to find out.
