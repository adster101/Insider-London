Looking for somewhere to go out Shoreditch way? Well, we&#8217;ve complied a list of some of our favourite bars <a href="/shoreditch-bars-drinking-guide-london/" target="_blank">here</a>, but for something really different, check out <a href="http://swingersldn.co.uk/" target="_blank">Swingers</a>, a new crazy golf course that will be opening in a Warehouse near Old Street on the 25 September.

For crazy golf enthusiasts, like \*cough\* us, this is great news: no longer will we have to trek to <a href="http://www.jurassicencounter.com/" target="_blank">New Malden</a> or <a href="http://www.worldofgolf.co.uk/golf-centres/sidcup/lost-island-encounter/" target="_blank">Sidcup</a> to practice our swing. But as well as a nine hole course, Swingers promises a 1920s-style club house, and a diner with a changing selection of street food from the likes of Pizza Pilgrims and Patty & Bun.

Combining competitive gaming with the opportunity for some good eating and drinking, the opening of Swingers is bound to go, err, with a swing. It&#8217;s around until December, and <a href="http://swingersldn.co.uk/events/category/swinger/" target="_blank">bookings</a> are open now.
