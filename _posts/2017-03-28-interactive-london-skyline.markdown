The skyline of London is world famous. With buildings such as The Shard, The Gherkin and the Walkie Talkie dominating London's skies, it's hard to imagine how the city looked in the past. As well as how it could have looked in the present and how it may develop in the future.

\
Let's look at how much London's skies have changed and grown over the years. Lets take Canary Wharf's One Canada Square. This was the tallest building in the United Kingdom for nearly ten years. But it soon lost it's title once The Shard had been completed ten years later. Once known as the tallest building in Europe and measuring a mighty 310 metres, it is difficult to think that there could have been, not one, but two new buildings which would have surpassed The Shard.

\
The London Millennium Tower, measuring at 386 metres and the London Bridge Tower which was to come out at a whopping 426 metres once it was completed, were both scrapped. Keeping The Shard at the top spot of being the United Kingdom's tallest building.

\
And that's just once of the many examples of how London's skyline could have developed into something so much different to what we know today. Flexi Offices have now designed this fun [Interactive London Skyline](http://www.flexioffices.co.uk/london-skyline/), which enables you to not only imagine, but see what the city would have looked like had certain buildings been built. You'll be able to discover more about the buildings in Central London, ranging from those that were proposed, approved and completed, or those that unfortunately never made the cut and were cancelled before construction began.
