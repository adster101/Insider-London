The group met with Kevin Le, Sales Director of Internet Initiative [Japan](https://www.iij.ad.jp/en/ )  and Shaw Xue , China CEO of [Verus Global](https://www.verusglobal.com/).

Internet Initiative Japan makes the internet a true social infrastructure whilst creating advanced shapes with high technical capabilities. From launching Japan’s first firewall service in 1994 to pioneering cloud service in 2000, Internet Initiative Japan has a long history of innovation. The last few years has seen IIJ complete the world’s first successful test of streaming high resolution audio reproduction of analogue sound.

Kevin Le further described international business expansion in the EU and the US, as well as Asian markets and gave an in-depth discussion on “How to start a business in China”. This included a brief history of Chinese markets and the control mechanisms within the sector. Students left with both a detailed understanding of the business model of Internet Initiative Japan and a broad perspective on the complexities of business in China.

Next up was Verus Global. Verus Global represents a new generation of the freight forwarding industry. Bridging the gap between global giants and small enterprises, the logistics pioneers offer a transparent and state-of-the-art tracking system. Verus Global allows for a streamlined shipping service with minimal touch points and real-time views of the shipping journey.
 
As well as introducing the business model and ethos of Verus Global, Shaw provided a fascinating overview of the international logistics industry and outlined the main players in the market. Explaining the business culture in China, Shaw introduced the Belt and Road Initiative, Trans-Pacific partnership and honed in on the China-Australia free trade agreement: CHAFTA. Along the way the implications of globalization vs trade protectionism were highlighted. All in all, it was a fantastic session which provided a great introduction to a pioneering logistics company as well as in-depth insight into global trade.
 
Insider London would like to warmly thank Shaw Xue of Verus Global and Kevin Le of Internet Initiative Japan for the wonderful presentations as well as Swinbourne University for their active participation in this memorable trip.
