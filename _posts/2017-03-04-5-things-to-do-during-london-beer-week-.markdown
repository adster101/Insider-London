Next week Londoners will begin celebrating one of their favourite tipples, which comes in the shape of beer. From Monday 13th to Sunday 19th March, London Beer Week will be celebrating beers, ales, lagers and also ciders, with a whole host of events. There are a range of activities that you can get involved with and here are just five ideas on what to do during London Beer Week...

**1. History of Drinking and Pubs Tour**

This two hour tour will give you a chance to not only celebrate and drink a pint or two of beer, but to learn about the history behind it. Visit some historic pubs, discover the techniques behind medieval brewing and travel through London's drinking history. Book your place [here](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/history-of-drinking-and-pubs/). 

**2. Spirit of Prague**

Get yourself down to the Truman Brewery in Shoreditch for this Czech inspired beer hall pop-up. From Thursday 16th to Sunday 19th March you'll have the opportunity to discover the tastes of the new Pravha and Staropramen, which is the number one Czech beer in the UK. This event is free to enter, where you'll enjoy free tastings, pretzels and discounted drinks. With a secret code word you'll be able to purchase a Prague priced beer for just 70p.

**3. The Beer Edit**

For three days (Thursday 16th to Saturday 18th March) this fantastic beer village will be taking over the Oval Space in East London. [The Beer Edit ](https://drinkup.london/beerweek/events/12461/the-beer-edit/)is a great way to celebrate London Beer Week. You'll have a chance to savour a whole range of different beers, and it'll play host to a number of exciting parties throughout the week too. 

**4. Visit a brewery**

With the craft beer scene in the UK having grown over the last few years, the capital have jumped on board and have opened the doors to a number of breweries around the city. Heading north of London? Check out Beavertown Brewery or the London Brewing Co.  Or if you're looking for a brewery in the east why not try Walthamstow's Wild Card Brewery? The Big Smoke Brew Co is great for those in the south and looking for a vegan friendly beer and those in the west you should head to Fuller's Brewery. 

**5. Sample a beer or two**

As part of London Beer Week a number of bars around the city will be offering drinks deals for the entire week. From Â£3 pints of cask ale at St Barts Brewery, to a beer based cocktail menu at Company Below, you'll have a number of new tipples and bars to try. For the full list of offers and bars taking part in London Beer Week please visit the official [DrinkUp London ](https://drinkup.london/beerweek/bars/)website.
