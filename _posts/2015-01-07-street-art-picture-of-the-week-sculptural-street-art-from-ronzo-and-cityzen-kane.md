When you think of street art, you may think of spray cans, but these works by Ronzo and CityZen Kane show it doesn&#8217;t need to look like that: both artists work in a more sculptural form.

This impressive piece is by the British artist CityZen Kane and was spotted in July 2014 on Club Row. He says that he work isn&#8217;t meant to represent anything specific, more that it will arouse curiosity when people discover it.

If sculptural street art is different for the viewer, it&#8217;s also different for the artist. Both CityZen Kane and Ronzo say that their work takes longer to put together, it&#8217;s limited by weight and &#8211; of course &#8211; it needs to be securely fastened to the wall to have any lasting power!

The London-based Ronzo, originally from Germany, is known as a pioneer of 3D graffiti &#8211; he&#8217;s been erecting his plaques and monsters since 2008.
