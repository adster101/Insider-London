Happy new year from Insider London! Before we plunge straight into another year of bringing you the finest London finds and facts, let&#8217;s look back over some of our favourite posts of last year.

**We&#8217;ve been Underground: **

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-13960 " src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tube-Facts-Infographic-Thumb.jpg" alt="Tube Facts Infographic Thumb" width="569" height="1570" />

We love the London Underground and Tube. So much so that we produced this almighty <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tube-facts-infographic/" target="_blank">London tube facts infographic</a> (for a larger version <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tube-facts-infographic/" target="_blank">just click here</a>). Something to think about before you decide to take the stairs at Hampstead. For more London Underground stats, we also pulled together <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/21/insider-londons-best-of-the-london-underground-and-tube/" target="_blank">our all-time favourite posts here</a>, and learned about plans for <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/10/17/the-next-generation-of-london-underground-trains/" target="_blank">the next generation of tube trains here</a>.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-13919 size-full" src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Growing-Underground-Tunnel.jpg" alt="Growing Underground Tunnel" width="569" height="430" />

But that&#8217;s not all the London Underground tunnels can be used for. We discovered all about <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/14/mail-rail-letters-on-the-underground/" target="_blank">the mail rail this November</a>, as well as plans by <a href="http://growing-underground.com/" target="_blank">Growing Underground</a> to cultivate herbs and vegetables in tunnels under the streets of Clapham &#8211; pictured above, and <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/02/14/growing-underground-in-london/" target="_blank">more here</a>.

One man who goes where others fear to tread underground &#8211; and is more than familiar with a tunnel or too is Bradley Garrett. Find out more about <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/07/21/exploring-beneath-londons-surface/" target="_blank">this urban explorer in this post</a>.

**Overground**

<p style="text-align: left;">
  It&#8217;s not all going on underground, you know. We also ventured skywards to share <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/06/11/london-rooftop-gardens/" target="_blank">five of London&#8217;s hidden rooftop gardens,</a> and joined in the debate about <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/06/02/london-needs-many-more-tall-buildings/" target="_blank">whether London needed many more tall buildings</a>. And, on the subject of modern architecture, we got to grips with <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/06/13/what-is-sustainable-architecture/" target="_blank">what the term &#8216;sustainable architecture&#8217; actually means</a>.

 **And <del>womblin&#8217;</del> Paddington-ing free**

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-15117 size-full" src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/jungle-book.jpg" alt="book art walking tour London" width="569" height="427" />

London&#8217;s streets have been home to all sorts of installations this year, from <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/28/the-paddington-trail/" target="_blank">Paddington</a> to [book benches](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/07/04/londons-book-bench-art/). We also discovered <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/03/fine-art-as-street-art-the-outings-project/" target="_blank">the Outings Project</a>: a project to take portraits out of the museums and onto the streets.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-18526 size-full" src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Sweet-Toof-barge.jpg" alt="Sweet Toof London barge" width="569" height="776" />

We&#8217;ve seen some great street art over the year too. <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/09/03/street-art-picture-of-the-week-sweet-toof-paul-insect-old-ford-lock-london/" target="_blank">One of our favourites</a> came via our Facebook follower, Andy Winter, who had the honour of getting his boat graffitied by two of London’s top artists: Sweet Toof and Paul Insect.

**2014&#8217;s Pop-ups and openings**

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-22150 size-full" src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/makersCAFE_mini.jpg" alt="makesCAFE alternative London" width="569" height="569" />

The pace and creativity of London&#8217;s pop-ups have continued to be astounding. We&#8217;ve covered loads, from <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/10/10/shuttlecock-and-a-new-pop-up-dining-experience/" target="_blank">Shuttlecock</a> to <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/09/05/swingers-crazy-golf-shoreditch/" target="_blank">Swingers</a>. 2014 was also the year London got its first 3D printing cafe &#8211; <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/09/19/insider-interview-makers-cafe/" target="_blank">find out more here</a>. We also spoke to the founder of one of London&#8217;s liveliest street food collectives, <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/06/30/petra-barran-kerb-interview/" target="_blank">KERB</a>.

**Quirky London**

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-23582 size-full" src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/IMG_50591.jpg" alt="london street art alternative walking tour" width="569" height="759" />

We love seeking out the quirky unusual around this great city. Check out <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/12/12/the-ghost-signs-of-london/" target="_blank">our recent post on ghost signs</a>, as well as the <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/12/01/vintage-london-street-signs/" target="_blank">design history of London&#8217;s street signs</a>. And for the really unusual, have you ever seen the lighthouse in King&#8217;s Cross. We found out about its past and plans for its future <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/10/24/the-kings-cross-secret-lighthouse/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-23274" src="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Photogenic-Features-p208-209-copy_mini.jpg" alt="Flickr_zoom_final" width="569" height="240" />

But for true London geeks, we really recommend you pick up a copy of The Information Capital. You can see some of its brilliant maps and infographics <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/10/london-the-information-project-infographics-that-will-change-the-way-you-view-the-city/" target="_blank">in this post</a>.

We hope you enjoyed 2014 as much as we did, and we look forward to seeing you on one of our <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/alternative-london-tours/" target="_blank">Insider London alternative walking tours in 2015</a>!
