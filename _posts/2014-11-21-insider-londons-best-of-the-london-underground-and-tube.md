Okay, we hold our hands up &#8211; we're real tube geeks at Insider London, as anyone who has been on one of our <a href="https://www.insiderlondon.com/london/educational-tours/london-underground-and-tube-tour/" target="_blank">London Underground and Tube Tours</a> would probably agree. We're also shared a lot of our, erm, enthusiasm on this blog, and have pulled together some of the best bits. Here is Insider London's Best of the London Underground and Tube.

One quick way to get your head around the stats of the Underground is ourTube facts infographic</a> (just click on the image to see a large version). Along a similar vein, although not strictly about tubes, are <a href="/blog/london-the-information-project-infographics-that-will-change-the-way-you-view-the-city/" target="_blank">these maps and infographics we shared from The Information Capital book</a>.

We also compiled <a href="/blog/quirky-tube-maps/" target="_blank">a list of our favourite quirky tube maps</a>, from house prices to Lego, via Super Mario. And an Elephant of course!

We heralded the arrival of Contactless payment on the tube last year and we also gave you a glimpse at the New Tube Project, set to roll out by 2020. Another major transportation project that's going to impact on the city is the CrossRail project.

Although we do have room for one final one. That is that Temple station, as seen in the Bond film, Skyfall isn't actually Temple at all. Want to know how we worked it out? There's <a href="/blog/james-bond-skyfall-london-underground-chase/" target="_blank">more information here</a>.
