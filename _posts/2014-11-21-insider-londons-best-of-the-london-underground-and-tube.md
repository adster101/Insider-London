Okay, we hold our hands up &#8211; we&#8217;re real tube geeks at Insider London, as anyone who has been on one of our <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-underground-tube-tours/" target="_blank">London Underground and Tube Tours</a> would probably agree. We&#8217;re also shared a lot of our, erm, enthusiasm on this blog, and have pulled together some of the best bits. Here is Insider London&#8217;s Best of the London Underground and Tube.

<img src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Tube-Facts-Infographic-Thumb.jpg" alt="Tube Facts Infographic Thumb" />

One quick way to get your head around the stats of the Underground is our <a href="/how-well-do-you-know-the-london-underground/" target="_blank">Tube facts infographic</a> (just click on the image to see a large version). Along a similar vein, although not strictly about tubes, are <a href="/london-the-information-project-infographics-that-will-change-the-way-you-view-the-city/" target="_blank">these maps and infographics we shared from The Information Capital book</a>.

We also compiled <a href="/quirky-tube-maps/" target="_blank">a list of our favourite quirky tube maps</a>, from house prices to Lego, via Super Mario. And an Elephant of course!

</p>

Back in 2012, we speculated <a href="/high-line-london-underground/" target="_blank">on the future of the Mail Rail tunnels</a>: a competition had decided that a suitable use for them might be a mushroom farm. Snap forward, and we now know <a href="/mail-rail-letters-on-the-underground/" target="_blank">a section of the tunnels is going to be used as part of a Postal Museum</a> set to open in 2016.

We heralded the arrival of Contactless payment on the tube last year and we also gave you a glimpse <a href="/the-next-generation-of-london-underground-trains/" target="_blank">at the &#8216;New Tube Project</a>&#8216;, set to roll out by 2020. Another major transportation project that&#8217;s going to impact on the city is the CrossRail project. We took a look at those (largely uninspiring) <a href="/kings-cross-station-kings-cross-regeneration/" target="_blank">station plans here</a>.

Finally, you can beat a quirky tube fact. Or eighty. Read <a href="/london-underground-tube-tours-facts/" target="_blank">part one here</a>, <a href="/london-underground-tube-tours-facts-part2/" target="_blank">part two here</a>, <a href="/london-underground-tube-tours-facts-part3/" target="_blank">part three here</a> and, phew!, <a href="/london-underground-tube-tours-facts-part4/" target="_blank">part four here</a>. That&#8217;s a lot of facts!

Although we do have room for one final one. That is that Temple station, as seen in the Bond film, Skyfall isn&#8217;t actually Temple at all. Want to know how we worked it out? There&#8217;s <a href="/james-bond-skyfall-london-underground-chase/" target="_blank">more information here</a>.
