Well, we did it &#8211; we made it through January, spirits &#8211; if not all our resolutions &#8211; intact. How are you doing? Why not make the most of the dark February days to do a bit of catching up with some of <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Insider London blog posts</a> from January?

One of the most exciting events to happen so far in 2015 is the opening (finally!) of the garden at the top of the Walkie-Talkie building. But has it been worth the wait?Â <a href="/the-opening-of-the-walkie-talkie-sky-garden/" target="_blank">We weigh up the verdicts here</a>.

We also got to know another London landmark better &#8211; how many of <a href="/the-gherkin-up-close-ten-great-facts/" target="_blank">these ten great facts about the Gherkin</a> did you know already?

London&#8217;s skyline is getting pretty crowded. We looked at the buildings vying to be top of the towers this year <a href="/londons-top-ten-skyscrapers-under-construction-in-2015/" target="_blank">in this blog post</a>. Any favourites? We also outlined another potentially exciting new scheme &#8211; the suggested <a href="/the-peckham-coal-line-londons-own-high-line/" target="_blank">&#8216;Coal Line&#8217; in Peckham</a>. Could this be London&#8217;s answer to New York&#8217;s High Line?

Let&#8217;s not forget that innovative architecture doesn&#8217;t have to mean skyscrapers. We took a look at some inspiring [London eco homes](/green-living-eco-homes-in-london/) <a href="/green-living-eco-homes-in-london/" target="_blank">here</a>. And &#8211; possibly more importantly &#8211; let&#8217;s remember innovative architecture doesn&#8217;t always work exactly to plan. Here <a href="/when-london-buildings-go-wrong/" target="_blank">are some examples of when London architecture has gone wrong, wrong, wrong</a>.

We&#8217;ve been checking out loads of street art this month, as ever. It&#8217;s a bit out of our usual circuit but there&#8217;s some really interesting street art happening in Camden right now a head of the redevelopment of the market. <a href="/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-camden-market/" target="_blank">Check that out here</a>. And how can we resist sharing <a href="/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-eine-and-invaders-evolving-style/" target="_blank">Luke and Darth, as depicted by Invader</a>?
