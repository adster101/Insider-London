Throughout June 2015, London will play host to a month-long, city-wide celebration of innovation and experimentation in architecture. The London Festival of Architecture was set up more than ten years ago by The Architecture Foundation, and each year introduces a new theme – with “Work in Progress” being the focus for 2015.

For an idea of what to expect, check out [our round-up of last year’s festival](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/08/11/london-festival-of-architecture-2014-the-best-bits/) – when the theme was “Capital”. Mayor Boris Johnson said of last year’s festival: &#8220;I’m hugely enthusiastic about good design and year-on-year the London Festival of Architecture continues to surpass its previous successes. The Festival makes an enormous contribution to London’s profile by promoting the talent, output and success of our architectural sector; and showcasing the innovation of London’s cultural sector through an outstanding partner programme that includes many of our leading institutions. The debate and engagement the festival creates helps shape this great city.&#8221;

Sustainability is a key theme in emerging architecture, with a global focus on green practices. We recommend heading to The Building Centre on Wednesday 19 June for a talk on Singapore’s Gardens by the Bay. The waterfront gardens feature two biomes ­­– controlled environments which host one Mediterranean springtime environment and one tropical mountain effect.

 There will also be a talk on sustainability in interior design on Wednesday 26 June, held in RIBA bookshop and hosted by Elina Grigoriou of Grigoriou Interiors – a design business which is renowned for its focused approach to sustainability. Their “floor-to-ceiling” approach means sustainability is integrated with every design, starting from the very beginning. Their philosophy begins with building an eco-friendly workplace and retail space, and extends to bamboo ceilings and reduced carbon emissions.

 The festival will also be focusing on a different kind of sustainability by nurturing new talent with a series of student shows, presenting work from all of London’s major architecture schools. These will be held alongside a line-up of exhibitions, installations and talks, as well as more interactive activities such as tours and film screenings. 2015’s programme will also see an expansion in international exhibits, such as “New Horizon”, which presents the work of up-and-coming Irish practices.

With some of Britain’s leading cultural and academic institutions – such as the Design Museum, the Royal Academy of Arts, the Royal Institute of British Architects, Serpentine Galleries and the Victoria & Albert Museum – involved, it promises to be an exciting month.
