We may have told you about some <a href="/walkies-great-places-walk-dog-london/" target="_blank">great places for dog walking</a>, but we&#8217;re also cat lovers at Insider London. Especially if they&#8217;re as striking and colourful as this purr-fect piece by Malarky. Malarky describes himself as a street artist, illustrator and skateboarder and his brightly coloured creatures have appeared on walls, trucks and &#8211; in this case &#8211; shutters around the capital. See his equally <a href="http://www.malarko.com/" target="_blank">colourful website for more</a>.
