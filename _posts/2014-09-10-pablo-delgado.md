You have to look closely if you want to spot the work of Pablo Delgado. This Mexican-born London-based street artists is known for his tiny people, taken from mass media and pasted onto walls in the capital. They&#8217;re even been given their own shadows for added realism.

As shown by this example we&#8217;ve spotted, Pablo&#8217;s imagery often plays with the surreal: a man on a segway next to a baby dressed as a cowboy sat on a chest of drawers? Just standard fare really.
