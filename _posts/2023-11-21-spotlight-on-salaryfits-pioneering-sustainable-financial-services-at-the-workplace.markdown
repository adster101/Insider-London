#### Building Sustainable Financial Services

At its core, SalaryFits is on a mission to promote sustainable financial services. Their focus extends beyond conventional offerings, diving deep into developer-friendly APIs that seamlessly integrate with payroll processes worldwide. This pioneering approach empowers global and regional benefit providers, such as lenders, insurers, and investment managers, to access real-time payroll data. Through this connectivity, these providers can efficiently collect payments via salary deduction, ensuring a hassle-free and secure financial ecosystem.

#### The Financial Landscape in the UK

In the UK, there is a growing need for the kind of services that SalaryFits provides. Recent [research](https://www.pwc.co.uk/industries/financial-services/insights/overlooked-and-financially-underserved.html) by PwC has revealed that 20.2 million adults in the UK are financially under-served. This means that at least 1 in 3 adults may have difficulty accessing credit from mainstream lenders. This represents a 50% increase in the size of this population since 2016. An additional 8.9 million adults exhibit signs of [financial fragility](https://www.totallymoney.com/blog/credit-report-data-must-change/). These individuals are among the most at risk of becoming under-served shortly as a result of a further squeeze on their finances as the cost of living crisis continues.

#### The Importance of Employer Support

The rising importance of employer support in the UK cannot be overstated. A staggering 70% of UK employees find themselves short by at least £600 annually, with 2 in 3 of those short by £1,200 each year. Furthermore, 51% spend time worrying about their financial situation every day of the week – twice as much compared to 2021. 23% are worrying multiple times a day. Nearly 3 in 4 (71%) agree that their mental health would improve if their employer gave them immediate [financial well-being support and benefits](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/more-eight-million-financially-strained-090651203.html).

#### The SalaryFits Approach 

SalaryFits recognises that employers are a valuable channel for reaching underserved, but financially stable individuals. With the support of employers, financial institutions can reach a much wider range of prospective clients. SalaryFits prov ides real-time access to payroll data, enabling instalment/payment collection through salary deductions on a monthly or weekly basis. This approach provides financial institutions with the opportunity to rapidly expand their [customer base](https://www.fintechfutures.com/2020/01/how-salaryfits-is-connecting-banks-with-the-unbanked/). It also serves as a tool to serve financially excluded individuals, increasing the financial institution's total addressable market.
