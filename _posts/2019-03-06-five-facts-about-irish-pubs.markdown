[Ireland has more than 10,000 pubs](http://irishpubcompany.com/history-of-irish-pubs/) and there are thousands more Irish pubs worldwide [from Moscow to Kathmandu](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/dec/15/irish-pubs-around-the-world)! In the run up to St Patrick's Day, and our [History of Drinking special on 16th March](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/history-of-drinking-and-pubs/), we present our top five facts about the beloved Irish pub. 

 

## 1.
The drinking traditions of St Patrick's Day are in fact very new. In Ireland, [pubs were not allowed to open on St Patrick's Day until 1973](https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/pubs-closed-ireland-st-patricks-day ). Before then there were limited drinking venues available on the national day, one of which was the Royal Dublin Society's national dog show. There was therefore a marked interested in canines with Irish poet and novelist Patrick Kavanagh renting a dog for the occasion while his contemporary, Brendan Behan, reputedly stole a poodle to ensure his entry. 

 

## 2. 
The oldest known piece of graffiti in Ireland is located in Dublin's oldest pub, the Brazen Head. Scratched into the window pane on the landing in a miniscule scribble are the words [“John Langan halted here 7th August 1726”](https://comeheretome.com/2011/10/08/oldest-graffiti-in-dublin/)

In 1872, having the name of the pub's proprietor over the front door [became a legal requirement](https://www.irishpost.com/life-style/a-brief-history-of-the-irish-pub-in-12-steps-90113).

[Pubs were once prime sites for storing dead bodies](https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/10-things-you-might-not-know-about-irish-pubs-1.2668558.).  The Coroners Act of 1846 declared that the best place to bring a dead body was a pub – the cellars were cool and slowed the body's decomposition rate.

Mooney & Son Brewery chain of Dublin bought the Boar's Head on Fleet Street, [the establishment was renamed The Tipperary and refurbished in true Irish style](https://www.londonremembers.com/memorials/tipperary-pub) .
