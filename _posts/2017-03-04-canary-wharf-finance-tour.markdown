New to the Insider London walking tour offering this year is our [Canary Wharf Finance Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/canary-wharf-finance-tour/). This private tour explores the area of, you guessed it, Canary Wharf.  

The area is often considered as the new financial hub of London, overtaking that of the City of London as the business and finance district of the capital. You'll hear comparisons of East End business district with London's city centre.  You'll also discover more about One Canary Wharf- the second tallest building in the UK, and the new developments that are taking place everyday in the area.

And despite being known as a financial district, there is also a myriad of amazing artwork to see when exploring the area of Canary Wharf. This January saw the introduction of Winter Lights, a free light installation throughout the area, which saw over 30 different pieces of work by artists from all over the world. Walking through the many green spaces that workers flock to in the warmer weather, you'll note a number of fantastic sculptures, that adds a sense of creativity to this otherwise business and financially driven area.  

This tour is perfect for anyone working or studying in the business, economics and finance industries. This walking tour is only available for private booking and can also be held in conjunction with our [London Finance Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/london-finance-walking-tour/).
