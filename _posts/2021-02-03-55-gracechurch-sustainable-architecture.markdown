### “We remain positive about the long-term future of the City office despite the current lockdown. It is fantastic, therefore, to see this significant vote of confidence from the developers of 55 Gracechurch Street." 
-Chair of the Planning and Transportation Committee at the City of London Corporation, [Alastair Moss](https://www.cityam.com/new-tall-building-at-55-gracechurch-street-approved-as-developers-embrace-post-pandemic-office-trends/) 

Despite widespread concern over the future of [office spaces in London](https://www.insiderlondon.com/blog/the-future-of-londons-business-districts/), a brand new tall building has just been approved in the Eastern cluster. The 30-storey office block scheme by the Tenacity Group is the first approved building of 2021.

Alongside the ongoing faith in demand for office blocks, the most impressive aspect of the building is its sustainable credentials. In fact, 55 Gracechurch Street is set to be the first tall building in the Eastern cluster to receive an “Outstanding” in the BREEAM (British Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method). This will put 55 Gracechurch Street in exceptional company – alongside the world-renowned [Bloomberg HQ](https://www.insiderlondon.com/blog/bloomberg-london/). 

### “Of particular merit to this development is an innovative ventilation strategy which uses fresh air, filtered from outside, to cool the office floors…. “The development will even reuse stonework from the existing building and include recycled steel with a commitment of an impressive 98% diversion of construction waste to landfill.”
-[Alastair Moss](https://www.pbctoday.co.uk/news/planning-construction-news/office-development-london/88140/), Chair of the planning and transportation committee at the City of London Corporation.

Urban greening is also a key feature of the development with extensive green walls, green roofs and tree planning. The developers hope that alongside meeting ecology and biodiversity goals, this will reduce noise and air pollution for the users of the building. Simulating rainfall, an innovative ceiling system will harvest rainwater to irrigate the plants. The garden terrace, which will offer panoramic views and a suspended treetop walkway, will be made available to the public.

The development supports sustainable transportation by widening pavements, reinstated lost pedestrian routes as well as creating new ones. There will also be more than 500 cycle parking spaces

### “Today marks a significant milestone for us and underlines our commitment to the City of London and the future of truly sustainable office buildings in the City…. We believe the future is bright for the right kind of space – space that 55 Gracechurch Street will provide – that embraces sustainability and provides flexibility"
