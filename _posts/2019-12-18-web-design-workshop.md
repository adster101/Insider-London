Last week, IT A-level students from Bilborough College in Nottingham journeyed to London for a web development workshop with [Archibald Butler](https://www.archibaldbutler.com/) – a talented and passionate web designer who has worked with Burger King, Asos, the Guardian, Deliveroo and many more well-known names. Archibald has more than ten years of experience in animation and is highly skilled in a variety of different coding languages.

Archibald shared his career path into freelance web design and delved into the peaks and troughs of his daily working life. He discussed the pros and cons of working freelance in web design and gave practical tips on personal finance management, professional presentation and how to pick a specialism. From typography to personal websites, portfolios and CVs the session explored how to stand out from the crowd.

Next Archibald gave a fantastic introduction to web design entitled “What do I need to learn to make a website”. This included information and explanation on different coding languages, editing software, useful tools to use and marketing and promotion considerations.

The second part of the workshop focused on the practical side to building a home page. This 90-minute session was both practical and inspiring for budding web designers of the future!

Insider London would like to warmly thank Bilborough College and Archibald Butler.
