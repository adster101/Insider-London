**Wandering around East London taking in the wealth of street art on offer has got to rank as one of the top activities to do in London. **

But the weather does sometimes (with me, seemingly, always) rather get in the way&#8230;

**Happily&#8230;.**

<a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/2013/05/13/street-artists-spotlight-spqr-joe-iurato/spqr2-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4993"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-4993" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/spqr21.jpg" alt="SPQR, street art, London walking tours, Signal Gallery, Insider London" width="569" height="621" /></a>

&#8230;there are myriad galleries to get your street art fix meaning that at any given moment any number of post-graffiti artists are plying their wares for your delectation.

**Galleries**

For a start, there&#8217;s [Tony&#8217;s](http://tonysgallery.com/ "Tony's Gallery"), [D*Face&#8217;s Stolen Space Gallery](http://www.stolenspace.com/ "D*Face's Stolen Space Gallery") and [The Brick Lane Gallery](http://www.thebricklanegallery.com/ "The Brick Lane Gallery"). But also&#8230;..

**[Signal Gallery](http://www.signalgallery.com/ "Signal gallery")**

Signal Gallery is arguably less well known than the others&#8230; though that is changing. Last month I popped along to Signal to see Brooklyn street artist [RAE and his first UK exhibition](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/2013/02/05/london-street-art-rae-signal-gallery/ "RAE and his first UK exhibition") &#8211; and was rather taken with it. So, I decided to head down to see [2+2](http://www.signalgallery.com/events/two-plus-two "2+2"), an exhibition that paired two contemporary fine artists with two street artists, [Bristolian stencil artist SPQR](http://www.spqr.uk.net/gallery/ "SPQR") and another Brooklyn-ite, [Joe Iurato](http://www.joeiurato.com/ "Joe Iurato").

**SPQR&#8230;**

<a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/2013/05/13/street-artists-spotlight-spqr-joe-iurato/spqr3/" rel="attachment wp-att-5009"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5009" src="/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/SPQR3.jpg" alt="SPQR, Signal Gallery, London walking tours, Insider London, street art" width="569" height="801" /></a>

Leaving Banksy comparisons aside&#8230; well, ok, maybe _not_ leaving comparisons aside&#8230;.SPQR favours making social comment with his art, at times utilising a brutalist, and abrasive touch. Yet there is also a touch of whimsy and humour &#8211; the smiling young woman earlier in the post brings to mind the nudge-nudge of Carry On films. Be sure to keep an eye out for more.

I absolutely adore this piece &#8211; the menace, the power and, well, the pure bonkersness of the imagery. And this?&#8230;.<figure id="attachment_5033" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Yessir, the man Iurato is my favourite of the two here. What sort of mind conjures these portraits?

The other great thing about Mr Iurato &#8211; he&#8217;s well in to his wine; a street artist-cum-sommelier. You don&#8217;t get too many of them to the pound.
