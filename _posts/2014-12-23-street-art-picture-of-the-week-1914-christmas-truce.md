  If you&#8217;ve been in Shoreditch recently, you may have spotted this new piece of street art, marking hundred years since the 1914 Christmas Truce.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The mural captures the moment in the First World War when German and British soldiers called a temporary truce in the fighting and met in No Man&#8217;s Land on Christmas Day. They exchanged drinks, food and cigarettes, and played football. It&#8217;s a powerful image of managing to find peace in the middle of hostilities.

This mural was a collaboration between two UK-based artists &#8211; Zadok and Ninth Seal &#8211; and Sokar Uno, a German artist. It has been mirrored by a second mural in German created by Alaniz, Addison Karl and Wesr.

You can find out more about the project on the <a href="http://www.visitflanders.co.uk/discover/flanders-fields-/the-christmas-truce-in-flanders-fields/" target="_blank">Visit Flanders site</a>.
