  <strong>With Halloween rapidly approaching, a timely festival of gruesome cakes opens this Friday at the <a href="http://www.smd.qmul.ac.uk/about/pathologymuseum/">Pathology Museum </a>at St. Bart’s in London. <a href="http://www.qmul.ac.uk/media/news/items/smd/83955.html">Eat Your Heart Out</a> pairs edible baked horrors, such as a smoker’s lungs or a toe infected with fungal disease, with talks from real medical experts.</strong>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Fresh in the wake of the hugely popular <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b013pqnm">Great British Bake Off</a>, this quirky pop-up event takes our new obsession with cakes out of the kitchen and into the laboratory. Co-organised by Pathology Museum Technician Carla Connolly and <a href="http://misscakehead.wordpress.com/">Miss Cakehead</a>, the festival is designed to raise awareness about diseases and health issues. Handily this will be achieved through a combination of stuffing your face, whilst also swallowing real, hard facts.

  But be warned that these are not for the faint hearted. These extremely realistic sugary snacks could easily turn weak stomachs. If you’re not prone to queasiness and end up opting for, say, a fairy bun topped with a large malignant mole, you’ll not only have a tasty cake to eat, but you’ll also receive a leaflet outlining the ways to check for changes in your moles.

  This is all running alongside lectures from a range of guest speakers, and the weekend event is split into three broad themes. Friday focuses on STD’s and sexual health, Saturday delves deep into the daily life of a pathologist, whilst Sunday is all about cancer and how to spot the signs.

  Carla Connolly, the Pathology Museum&#8217;s technician and assistant curator says: “We hope to create an interest in anatomy and pathology. For example raising awareness of the need for blood donations, educating visitors about diseases and ensuring people understand the dangers of alcohol and smoking. But in a way that’s fun and totally unforgettable.”

  So if you’re looking for a piece of totally unique London as All Hallows’ Eve approaches, head down to the Pathology Museum for bloods, guts and sponge galore.
