While last week&#8217;s street art pictures <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/19/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-bicicletas-sem-freios-and-cranio/" target="_blank">took us to Brazil</a>, this week we&#8217;re exploring new worlds and planets thanks to the work of Jim &#8216;Probs&#8217; Vision and the End of the Line collective. They specialise in fantastical, large scale murals, largely created with spray cans. Because it&#8217;s a cold November day, we&#8217;ve decided to treat you to not one, not two, not three but &#8211; you&#8217;ve guessed it! &#8211; four examples of their work. Allow yourself to be transported somewhere else entirely&#8230;
