At Insider London, we love to show people the more unusual sides of London. We also believe in the concept of an inclusive society, where everyone can enjoy exploring this wonderful City freely. That’s why we’re very happy to support Guide Dogs in their aim for equal mobility of people with sight loss!

This August, we will run four special tours, the proceeds of which will fully go to Guide Dogs. In order to raise as much money as possible, **we have something special up our sleeves**: Normally, our educational tours are only available to private parties. For this fundraiser, we have decided to open up two very popular educational tours for individual guests as well!

If you are interested in booking, please get in touch with Jonas at [jonas@insider-london.co.uk](mailto:jonas@insider-london.co.uk). The tours are:

* 19th August, 2pm - The hidden history of the [London Underground and Tube](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/london-underground-and-tube-tour/)

* 20th August, 2pm - The [Death and Debauchery Tour](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/the-death-and-debauchery-tour/) through London’s darker past

* 26th August, 2pm - The [Silicon Roundabout Tour](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/silicon-roundabout-and-tech-city-tour/) around Shoreditch’s start-up scene

* 27th August, 2pm - The [City of London Finance Tour](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/london-finance-walking-tour/)

## What is Guide Dogs

Guide Dogs is a charity that aims to provide people with sight loss with the support they need to be able to move around safely and confidently, to get out of their homes and be able to live life the way they choose. They achieve this not only through their world-famous guide dogs, but also through campaigning passionately for improvements to mobility opportunities for blind and partially sighted people. In doing so, they tackle problems that affect everyone, for example the lack of audio-visual announcements in buses (which is a standard in London - thank you TfL! - but hardly anywhere else), or the hindrances created by cars that unnecessarily park on the pavement and force parents with prams, wheelchair users, and guide dog owners onto the streets.

## Why we do it

We wholeheartedly believe that this world is for everyone. In September, a team of Guide Dogs employees and supporters will tackle the Coniston Challenge, a fundraising challenge that will take them to the Lake District to hike, cycle and kayak a total of more than 22km. They do this to raise awareness for their cause and funds for their charity. We are impressed by their dedication and passion, and will support them.
