Here at Insider London, we recently caught up with Antique Clothing to discuss their exciting new collaborative project with London street artist Ben Slow. You can [read the interview here](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/01/17/antique-ben-slow-collaboration/ â€Ž), but if you&#8217;ve already done so, you may have noticed our mention of a free t-shirt giveaway.

As with all of Antique Clothing&#8217;s designs, this Ben Slow t-shirt is a limited edition. Only a certain number will be printed, and when they&#8217;re gone, they&#8217;re gone. Just as a lot of London&#8217;s street art can disappear in a matter of hours or days, so too can these unique t-shirts.

If you&#8217;d like to win one of these unique t-shirts, then entering the competition couldn&#8217;t be simpler.

**Step 1**

Visit and &#8220;like&#8221; the Insider London Facebook page by [clicking here](https://www.facebook.com/insiderlondon).

**Step 2**

Write your name in a comment on the official competition post, found on our Facebook wall or by [clicking here](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=632410546820518&set=a.431801010214807.102215.171999056195005&type=1).

**Step 3**

Cross your fingers!

We will be closing the competition in two weeks&#8217; time, and will be contacting the lucky winner through Facebook. You&#8217;ll need to supply us with a postal address at which to send you the t-shirt, but you won&#8217;t need to pay any postage.

Good luck!
