Summer is the perfect time to explore London and we&#8217;ve been all over the city this July, from skips to subterranean tunnels. Been too busy eating ice creams to read our blog? Here&#8217;s what you have missed.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/London-walking-tour-book-bench.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15116" src="/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/London-walking-tour-book-bench.jpg" alt="London walking tour book bench" width="569" height="436" /></a>
</p>

An added incentive for getting out and about at the moment are <a href="/londons-book-bench-art/" target="_blank">the book benches</a>: decorated benches, each dedicated to a different London tale. <a href="/londons-book-bench-art/" target="_blank">We checked out some of Greenwich&#8217;s offerings</a>. But, although we consider ourselves eager explorers of London, we haven&#8217;t taken it to such extremes as <a href="/exploring-beneath-londons-surface/" target="_blank">Bradley Garrett</a> &#8211; his new book delves into the hidden realms <a href="/exploring-beneath-londons-surface/" target="_blank">beneath London&#8217;s streets</a>.

We have been getting to know King&#8217;s Cross even better recently, from the stunning array of <a href="/art-station-the-kings-cross-regeneration/" target="_blank">public art</a> in the area to <a href="/kings-cross-station-kings-cross-regeneration/" target="_blank">the impact of the station itself</a>. We spoke to arty newcomers <a href="/the-house-of-illustration-kings-cross/" target="_blank">The House of Illustration</a> and got our hands grubby at <a href="%20/global-generation-the-skip-garden/" target="_blank">the Skip Garden project</a> (if you&#8217;d like to do more of that, check out our guide to <a href="/global-generation-the-skip-garden/" target="_blank">ecology volunteering projects in London</a>).

One of our favourite images this month comes <a href="/oh-wow-look-its-some-street-art-by-mobstr/" target="_blank">courtesy of Mobstr</a>: we do like wow-ing at street art here! Meanwhile, Nick considered the tricky issues of <a href="/streetwise-artful-marketing/" target="_blank">how street artists market themselves</a>, and we gave away copies of the V&A&#8217;s fab street art prints book. Did you win? <a href="/the-winners-of-the-va-street-art-books/" target="_blank">Take a look here</a>. And don&#8217;t forget to check back over the rest of August for more London discoveries.
