If you’re planning a school trip to London for primary, secondary, college or sixth form students – here are some great tips and ideas for what to do on the day.

If you're a teacher planning a school trip for your students, London is a wonderful location to visit for a day or weekend. There are plenty of fantastic cultural, historical and educational things to do and see for children of all ages. Whether your school trip is for primary or secondary children or college and sixth form students, there are many options to choose from in and around London…

##Visit a Museum or Gallery
A classic school trip staple, visiting a museum or gallery is a great way to introduce students of all ages to art, culture and history. London’s Science Museum offers a selection of interactive experiences perfect for students to learn in a hands-on environment. Alternatively, the British Museum run special taught sessions spanning a range of curriculum subjects perfect for school trips. The National Gallery also offer interactive gallery sessions for schools run by specialist educators – best of all, these are free for UK schools! And London is home to plenty of other smaller or less well-known museums that are well worth a visit. Why not organise a trip to The Wallace Collection, The Horniman Museum, or the Charles Dickens Museum? If you’re after something a bit different, jump aboard the HMS Belfast to see a real battleship. The HMS Belfast even offers school groups the opportunity to sleep over on the boat in real sailors’ bunks!

##Go To The Zoo
ZSL London Zoo is well set up to cater to school visits. They have a selection of primary, secondary or post-16 education sessions and study programmes for you to book. There are over 700 species of animals at the zoo, including reptiles, penguins, gorillas, lions, butterflies, and meerkats. Students of all ages (not to mention the teachers!) will love meeting and learning about all the different creatures.

##See a Show
A visit to London to see a show makes a really exciting school trip. For younger students, take advantage of a matinee performance so that you’ll be finished early in the day. There are many brilliant West End shows that are suitable for children of all ages, including Charlie and the Chocolate Family, family favourite The Lion King, and Matilda. On top of that, Aladdin will soon be coming to the West End for the first time. If you’re looking for something that will fit with your students’ literature studies, Shakespeare's Globe is an obvious choice for introducing students to the works of The Bard. On the other hand, if you’re planning a trip for younger children, The Unicorn Theatre and Polka Theatre are both dedicated to making great children's theatre.
