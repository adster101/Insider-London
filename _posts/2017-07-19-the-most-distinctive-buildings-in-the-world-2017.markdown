During the [World Architecture Festival ](https://www.worldarchitecturefestival.com/)people from across the globe gather to decide upon some of the best buildings in the world. These range from completed buildings, as well as those future projects from a range of categories. This year marks the tenth year of the festival and the shortlist of contenders for the World Building of the Year 2017 have now been announced. And here are just four of our favourites.

**1. The Smile (London, United Kingdom)** Who could have guessed that one of our favourite buildings from the list turned out to be from London? The Smile created by Allison Brooks Architects, was originally revealed as part of the London Design Festival- which takes place every year. The material made to erect the building- American Tulipwood, is said to be stronger than concrete.

**2. Urban Digger (Copenhagen, Denmark)** Created by BIG (Bjarke Ingels Group) the Urban Rigger is a property made from shipping containers, very similar to BoxPark in London. This carbon neutral property provides affordable and sustainable homes for university students.

**3. British Airways i360 (Brighton, United Kingdom)** Listed in the Hotel and Leisure category the i360 measures at 162 metres high, which makes it the tallest moving observation tower in the world. It was created by Mark Barfield Architects and the glass observation can hold up to 200 people at a time.

**4. Penguin Parade Visitor Centre (Phillip Island, Australia) **Yet to be completed the Penguin Parade created by Terroir has been shortlisted in the Culture category for Future Projects. This new visitor centre increases the hopes that tourism and economy in regional Victoria will rise. What's more, the centre will restore a number of hectares for Little Penguins to ensure that research on this community can continue.
