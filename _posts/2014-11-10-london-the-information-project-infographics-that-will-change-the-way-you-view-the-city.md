        London is the most data-heavy capital of the world. Well, that&#8217;s according to James Cheshire and Oliver Uberti the authors of this new book, <em style="color: #000000;"><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1415544968279_106751"><a href="http://theinformationcapital.com/" target="_blank">London: The Information Capital</a>. </span></em><span id="yui_3_16_0_1_1415544968279_106751">And, given that we spend most our days trying to keep up with London&#8217;s dizzying range of facts and figures, we can well believe that. </span>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This new book presents 100 maps and infographics that tell us more about London &#8211; everything from who we go to where we go and what we like. Take a look at these three sample graphics from the book to get a flavour of what&#8217;s in store: just click on each image to see a larger version.

        &#8220;There is order and beauty in the chaos of your commute.&#8221; Although, that might seem debatable, there&#8217;s no denying there&#8217;s something very pleasing about the lines of colour shown in the infographic above: in fact, it shows London&#8217;s most exited stations each morning by the origin location. And that&#8217;s not all the transport facts you can pick up in the book: we&#8217;ve also learnt that the trains of the London Underground network log more than 75 million kilometres a year &#8211; that’s like circling the Earth at the Equator 1,900 times. In addition, in 2013, Londoners took 2.4 billion bus journeys.

              &#8220;They Came, They Saw, They Spent&#8221; illustrates the overseas visitors to the UK in 2012. You can see how visitors from the United States dominate the stats. Interestingly, it also shows how much each visitor spends, and while the average American spends £800 on a trip to London; the average Saudi will spend over triple that. While that figure no doubt includes a fair few souvenirs, spare a thought of what&#8217;s left behind: 2,580 mobile phones, 100 walking sticks and 2,380 pairs of glasses were left at Heathrow Airport in 2013.

            Finally, can you guess what the light areas in this map show? It&#8217;s actually the most photographed areas of the city, according to Flickr at least. Perhaps no surprises that Trafalgar Square, Westminster and Buckingham Palace are well lit up, but it&#8217;s interesting to see how well recorded our green spaces are too.
