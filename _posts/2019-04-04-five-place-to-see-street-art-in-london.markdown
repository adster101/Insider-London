## Camden Town 

 
Whilst some say Camden Town is now more popular with tourists than alternative subcultures, there is nowhere like it. Both the main streets around the famous markets and the lesser known backstreets are a favourite stop for artists from around the world. Camden is still a favourite stop for artists. Highlights include a tribute to Camden legend Amy Winehouse, by Otto Schade.

## Peckham 

 

Want to beat the crowds? Venture down South for some cool underground pieces in up-and-coming Peckham. It’s a great location to hunt pieces by London legend Artful Dodger,  an urban artist well-known in the sphere since the 1980s who allegedly reached [#2 on Transport for London’s most wanted list](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/spray-it-loud-1572309.html). With a strong anti-establishment feel and no frills attached, his work is still painted illegally – impressive considering its prominent location and attention to detail.

## Brixton 

 

Just a few miles East then “The Oxford Street of the South” has an impressive range of huge and colourful murals. The Brixton street art scene was further enhanced by the [Brixton Design Trail](https://www.brixtondesigntrail.com/). Part of the London Design Festival, the BDT commissions public artwork as well as organising art workshops and events every September. For fans of Bowie a pilgrimage to this Jimmy C piece is a must-do.

## Leake Street Tunnels 

 

Under Waterloo Station, this 300m tunnel was formerly used by the Eurostar. Now its home to now is an artistic treasure trove. Since Banksy held the “Cans Festival” here in 2008 where he invited artists from all over the world to paint, it's been a well-known and well-loved spot for street art spotters. The tunnel is also home to the multi-disciplinary arts venue: [The Vaults](https://www.thevaults.london/) and beautifully lit up at night.

## Shoreditch 

 

Saving the best until last – it's said that Shoreditch has the second greatest concentration of street art in the world, second only to New York. From world famous artists like Banksy, Invader and Shepard Fairey to local underground artists and rising stars, then Shoreditch has it all. Intermixed with funky boutiques, art galleries and an amazing range of street food, the area certainly has cool factor (even if prices have risen dramatically). Join us on a [Shoreditch Street Art Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/street-art-tour-london/) to explore the debates and controversies of London’s colourful street art scene and discover stunning art in varied forms.
