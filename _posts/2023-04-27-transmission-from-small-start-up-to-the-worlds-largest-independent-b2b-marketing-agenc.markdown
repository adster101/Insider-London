In the world of marketing, [Transmission](https://transmissionagency.com/en-gb) is a name that has quickly risen to become a major player. Founded in the UK, as a media and content marketing agency solely working with technology businesses, Transmission has come a long way since its early days. In this blog post, we'll take a look at the journey of Transmission and how it has become the largest global independent B2B marketing agency in the world.

##### From Pulse to Pace to Transmission

In 2013, Pulse was established as a media and content marketing agency solely working with technology businesses. Three years later, in 2016, they launched their German B2B tech agency called Pace. The following year, in 2017, Transmission was born as a B2B non-tech agency.

In 2018, Pulse, Pace, and Transmission continued to scale, winning multiple awards and accolades for their client work. Work started to become more global, and they began to eye up new international offices to open. The following year, in 2019, the US, Singapore, and Australia offices launched. All companies rebranded as Transmission, and with their international growth, it was important to reposition the agency with one goal and one set of values.  

##### Transmission's Full-Service Offering

What sets Transmission apart from the rest is its ability to provide a truly full-service marketing function. With industry-leading expert teams covering data and insight, innovation, social, paid media, creative, content, brand, insight strategy and planning, client services, virtual events, organic social, reporting, and optimisation, they specialise in the entire marketing function. Some of their top clients include HP, Microsoft, AWS, EY, Maersk, and AMEX.

Despite being a relatively young company, Transmission is recognised as an influential thought leader in the B2B marketing space. Their industry-leading research reports have helped shape the conversation on the latest marketing trends and best practices. 

Transmission is proud to be an independent agency, which means they have the global agility and experience to help B2B brands drive the now and define the next.
