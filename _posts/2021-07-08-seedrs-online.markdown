This week Insider London was proud to co-host a fantastic online event with leading equity crowdfunding platform, [Seedrs](https://www.seedrs.com/) for a prestigious international business school. This session was led by Scott Simpkin, a Senior Campaigns Associate & Team Manager, with an extensive background both as an entrepreneur and in the wider start-up landscape. With MBA students joining from all over the world, the webinar addressed key questions around start-up finance. 

The session began with the fascinating journey of Seedrs from its origins as a child of the financial crisis with a vision to democratise start-up funding, to becoming the first equity crowdfunding platform in the world to be recognised by a financial regulatory body. The success of Seedrs is undeniable. With 40% of businesses raising below £500,000 now using equity crowdfunding, Seedrs provides scalable businesses with the potential for multiple funding rounds with a fantastic platform and the opportunity to build a community of evangelists around the product. On the Seedrs platform, a remarkable 9 out of 10 businesses on Seedrs reach their funding target.

Alongside the Seedrs business model and the development of equity crowdfunding, Scott explored the current practical barriers faced by entrepreneurs raising capital including the technical and legal processes. The creation of new revenue streams, the monetisation of products and the advantages of crowdfunding over VCs were all explored. With great input and questions from students, the session looked to the future of start-up funding. We cannot wait for the next webinar!
