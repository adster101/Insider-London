The event begins at 10pm on Saturday 26 October and doesn’t end until 3 am. Don’t forget to dress in your scariest costume if you plan on entering their contests or sweeping your neighborhood werewolf off his/her feet!
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  30.  <a href="http://www.designmynight.com/london/bars/1-big-night-out-pub-crawl-leicester-square/zombie-halloween-bar-crawl">Zombie Halloween Pub Crawl:</a> In case you weren’t aware, zombies love their pubs just as much as any living Londoner. The night promises lots of drinks, a zombie makeover, and even a free T-Shirt. Tickets are £20 and the crawl begins at 19:30 Thursday-Saturday during Halloween weekend.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  29. <a href="http://www.designmynight.com/london/bars/35-commercial-road/pop-up-ping-pong-halloween-special">Pop Up Ping Pong Halloween Special</a>: Zombies and the apocalypse go together like candy and stomach aches. PUPP has put together a special ping-pong event stocked with an interactive music playlist, bloody good street food and, of course, ping-pong tables. The event takes place 26 October, entry price is £10, and doors open at 18:30.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  28. <a href="http://www.viewlondon.co.uk/whatson/halloween-at-book-club-article-11781.html">Halloween at Book Club</a>: For three nights only, the Book Club is hosting special Halloween themed events. Ever wanted to meet a dead celebrity? The Book Club doesn’t promise to bring back the dead, but it does host a special event where you can dress up like your favourite celeb and feel just as important as they were. If that doesn’t suit you, then maybe surrounding yourself in taxidermy will make you feel more at home. Or why not get lost in a terrifying funhouse? The events cost between £5 and £15 and runs 29-31 October.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  27. <a href="http://winterwell.co.uk/halloween/">Winterwell Halloween Party</a>: Held in one of London’s most haunted Victorian houses, Winterwell’s Voodoo and Black Magic party will not disappoint. The event takes place on 26 October at 20:00 and tickets are £20. Don’t forget to dress up in your best voodoo or black magic costume.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  26. <a href="http://www.ediblecinema.co.uk/">Halloween at the Edible Cinema</a>: While it may not be a party or a pub crawl, the Edible Cinema’s Halloween movie is sure to delight. The cinema puts together small packages of food specially made for the movie on screen. From their website, Edible Cinema describes their menus as focusing “less on literal interpretations of food shown on screen and more on environment, specific words and overall feelings. For example, a scene in Pan’s Labyrinth where characters ran through a pine forest was matched with Pine Smoked Popcorn, giving pine aroma and flavour while also delivering the ‘crunch’ of feet on the needle laden forest floor.” They are showing An American Werewolf in London on the 26th and 27th of October.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  25. <a href="http://wiltons.org.uk/event.php?p=642">Dracula at Wilton’s Music Hall</a>: The show runs from 9 October to 2 November and its dancers have received rave reviews. You read that right: Dracula is not a play, but more a grand dance performance. Tickets are £25 per person and it’s recommended that no one under the age of 14 attend.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  24. <a href="https://www.barbican.org.uk/education/event-detail.asp?id=13898">Halloween at Barbican</a>: It’s not just one event, but a night full of events in one place.

The best part? All events are free and you can just drop in at any time, but not all events run all the time so be sure to check their website.

The website even boasts that “there are also surprises onboard the bus &#8211; it was indeed once a funeral bus, so it&#8217;s not a surprise that the dead may have left some imprint on the vehicle .” The tour lasts a minimum of an hour and costs between £14 and £20 per person.
</p>

<p dir="ltr">
  16. <a href="http://www.canalmuseum.org.uk/whatson/halloween.htm">London Canal Museum</a>: If you’re not a fan of buses, then maybe a spooky boat tour would be a better fit.

There are chances for witch encounters and, most importantly, sweets for the kids. Adults must have children with them and vice versa.
