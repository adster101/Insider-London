I have not one but two things to announce in relation to One Direction&#8217;s song &#8216;One Thing&#8217;&#8230;

The first is that I&#8217;m 30 and One Direction are my guilty pleasure. I have their calendar and I am going to see them twice on their 2013 tour. I probably should be ashamed but I&#8217;m not.

The second is that I&#8217;ve mapped the main locations from the &#8216;One Thing&#8217; video (shot in a day in London and chock full of classic British sights) so you can create your own little One Direction tour when you next come to London. Have a look at all the video screengrabs then recreate it using the Google Map at the bottom <img src="/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />

Busking in Trafalgar Square&#8230; I wonder how many pence they made?

And the final shot, of Lambeth Bridge, very apt in its red, white and blue.
