    There was a time on the British high street when on almost every shopfront you would see a hand-painted sign, be it a pub, hairdresser, grocer or baker. Nowadays the art of the sign-writing is a dying trade. The skill and technique takes years to perfect and there’s only a few traditional writers left in Britain. On a recent visit home &#8211; a small seaside town on the east coast of Scotland &#8211; I was disheartened to find that the hand-painted signs that used to sit above the majority of the shops have been replaced with cheap, crude vinyl lettering. Advances in technology have made the process a lot easier and quicker, but it doesn’t compare with the planning and perfecting of each character in a single stroke.

    Hand-painted lettering is of course not completely dead yet. In some ways urban street art is reviving the craft. In 2010 US artist <a href="http://www.firstandfifteenth.net/cv/">Steve Powers</a> started “A Love Letter For You” in Philadelphia, a large-scale mural project conveying love messages through the medium of hand-painted letters. Powers first became known as a graffiti artist in the eighties under the name ESPO. His artwork back then was considered as anti-social, but is now helping to revitalise areas, spreading his messages of love to the streets of New York, Dublin, Belfast and London.

    Cool Hoxton streetwear shop <a href="http://goodhoodstore.com/">Goodhood</a> is well connected with the London urban art scene. Painting their shop signage is street artist <a href="http://wordtomother.co.uk/">Word To Mother</a>.

    The heritage trend in fashion has also helped the dying art. Brands such as <a href="http://aubinandwills.com/en-gb/home">Aubin & Wills</a> and <a href="http://www.cathkidston.co.uk/">Cath Kidston</a> immerse themselves in all things British.

  <p>
    Whether this is a fully-fledged revival of sign-writing is debatable, but there are enough examples to suggest that beautiful sign-writing is on its way back.
