> UN: “The resilience of cities, where most people will live by 2050, will certainly depend on the level of greenness and clean air, biodiversity and overall human well-being.” ([UN, 2019](https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/rewilding-londons-urban-spaces.)) 


Such benefits of re-wilding are clear in a city like London, which is known for its stressful pace of life and serious issues with [air pollution](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/15/nearly-9500-people-die-each-year-in-london-because-of-air-pollution-study). Less well-known perhaps are the [wildlife species at risk in the UK](https://friendsoftheearth.uk/nature/ipbes-biodiversity-report-friends-earth-calls-uk-government-step-avoid-catastrophic-nature) with habitat loss remaining a significant contributing factor as well as the genuine concerns about the potential [“great flood risk”](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/london-flood-risk-map-shows-areas-of-the-capital-most-in-danger-10039405.html) that the capital faces as the climate crisis continues. Re-wilding can help us address all these issues, so we take a look at five of London’s most exciting projects.
