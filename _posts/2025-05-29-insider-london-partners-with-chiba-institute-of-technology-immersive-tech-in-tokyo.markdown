At Insider London, we’re delighted to announce our partnership with the Chiba Institute of Technology (CIT), Japan’s oldest private technical university. As part of our [Tokyo Programme](httphttps://www.insiderlondon.com/asia/tokyo/), we recently hosted an interactive visit that showcased CIT’s cutting-edge innovations and engaging student experiences.

#### Exploring CIT in Tokyo

CIT is renowned for its cutting-edge research centres, including the Future Robotics Technology Center (fuRo), the Planetary Exploration Research Center, and the Software Technology and Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory.  These facilities underscore the university's commitment to advancing technology and innovation. 

Our journey began at CIT’s Tokyo Campus, where students and faculty gathered for a hands-on introduction to Japan’s leading engineering research. The modern facility, nestled in one of Tokyo’s most vibrant districts, sets the perfect stage for technological exploration and collaboration.

#### Cyber Wheel: Revolutionising Mobility

One of the highlights of the visit was the Cyber Wheel demonstration. CIT researchers showcased this novel, an all-terrain personal transporter that reimagines urban mobility. Attendees had the chance to ride the Cyber Wheel themselves, experiencing first-hand how its intuitive balance controls and responsive handling can navigate complex city environments. This session opened discussions on robotics, mechanical engineering, and the future of personal transportation in smart cities.

#### VR Marathon: Pushing Virtual Boundaries

Next, we moved into immersive virtual reality with CIT’s VR Marathon project. Participants donned VR headsets and participated in a simulated marathon through digital recreations of historic Tokyo landmarks. The experience combined physical activity with advanced VR technologies, illustrating how virtual environments can enhance fitness, training, and entertainment. Students and faculty alike were impressed by the seamless integration of motion tracking, real-time feedback, and expansive virtual landscapes.

#### Space Technology with NASA

CIT’s collaboration with NASA offers another layer of excitement. During the visit, our students explored the latest space technology co-developed by CIT and NASA, including micro-satellite components and sensor systems designed for low-earth orbit missions. As a creative twist, participants also had the opportunity to design their own virtual fireworks display, learning about propulsion systems and atmospheric conditions in a hands-on workshop that blended aerospace engineering with artistic expression.

#### Join Our Tokyo Programme

Chiba Institute of Technology’s pioneering work perfectly complements Insider London’s mission to bridge academic learning with real-world industry practice. Our [Tokyo Programme](https://www.insiderlondon.com/asia/tokyo/) now includes bespoke visits to CIT and its unique tech experiences, offering international students and professionals an unparalleled insight into Japan’s technological ecosystem.
