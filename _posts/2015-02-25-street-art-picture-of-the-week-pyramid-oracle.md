Love this piece by Pyramid Oracle, as spotted in Shoreditch. This piece is hand-pasted but you can see a variety of styles at work on this US-based artist&#8217;s recent London visit. There&#8217;s more examples to <a href="/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-camden-market/" target="_blank">spot in Camden</a>, or you can see more on <a href="https://instagram.com/pyramidoracle/" target="_blank">the Pyramid Oracle Instagram feed</a>.
