Christmas is coming fast. Naturally, as tour guides, we think [walking tours are the best Christmas gifts](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/why-experiences-are-the-best-gifts/). That's why this year, we have a few special tours up our sleeves for you. Of course, there's many options to <a href="#gifts">give the gift of a walking tour</a>, but if you're looking for something really festive, check out our Christmas Specials: **Christmas in Covent Garden** on 23rd December and **History of Drinking & Pubs** on 30 December. Every guest on these tours will receive a complimentary stocking filler. If you're excited about walking tours, you'll love these ones!

## Christmas in Covent Garden
*Saturday, 23rd December, 11am*

Delve into secret London with this light-hearted two hour tour, rich in history, architecture and comedy. This is a tour of the quirky history of the much loved hub of theatre, entertainment and Christmas shopping! Starting at Covent Garden and finishing at Trafalgar Square, the route mixes the iconic with the obscure, and explores the hidden gems of a historic district.

Our guides will take you on a journey through the history of the area from the medieval convent to the Georgian centre of scandal and debauchery! Meet Covent Garden's lively inhabitants, including the man who invented Christmas as we know it. In short, throw away the stuffy history books! Discover the hilarious and downright bizarre back-stories of some of [London's most well-known landmarks](http://www.londonhut.com/london/attractions) and shopping streets â€“ now with a festive twist!

Start your new year celebration early! Come explore the glorious British obsession with boozing! Relax into a nice bevvy in four historic pubs and take a trip through time.

Cast your vote in the centuries-long battle between beer and ale and delve deep into the Victorian gin craze. Join us as we bring in the New Year in true British style... at the pub!
