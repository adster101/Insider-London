Whether you are booked on to a [London walking tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/educational-walking-tours/) over the Easter weekend or you are visiting the capital with your children for the holidays, there are plenty of things to do to keep you busy. 

Here are our pick of the best events taking place over Easter in London.

## 1 - Peter Rabbit at Kew Gardens

Hot on the heels of the release of the Peter Rabbit film, [Kew Gardens](https://www.kew.org/kew-gardens/whats-on/a-big-day-out-with-peter-rabbit) in south-west London have created a Beatrix Potter-themed trail.

Children will love taking part in games, dressing up, seeing Mr McGregor’s shed, attending storytelling workshops and making their own bunny ears as they embark on the adventure. 

This event opens on Good Friday (March 30th) and will run throughout the Easter holidays until April 15th, so there is plenty of time to wander around the Botanical Gardens during your London break.

## 2 - See live re-enactments at Tower of London

History fans will love to venture to Tower of London, as there will be live historical re-enactments of the 1,000-year-old fortress’ attack. 

You can witness guards battle with each other during the 35-minute show, taking place three times a day from March 16th, and learn all about the history of one of the country’s most famous landmarks. 

## 3 - Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea at One Aldwych

Head to one of London’s most prestigious hotels, [One Aldwych](http://www.onealdwych.com/food-drink/afternoon-tea), for a truly decadent treat and enjoy its Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Afternoon Tea. 

Most of us indulge in chocolate goodies over the Easter weekend, and there is no better place to do it than here where you can enjoy golden chocolate eggs, chocolate caramel milk, homemade candyfloss, bubblegum panna cotta, and blueberry and white chocolate cake pops, as well as delicious sandwiches and scones. 

Children will, no doubt, love this Roald Dahl-inspired high tea, but it is by no means just for kids to enjoy!
