The streets around Brick Lane are full of interesting street art. One of the most distinctive is this Smiley by Chilean-born, now London-based artist Otto Schade. Schade is fascinated by surrealist art, frequently using this imagery of his bandages in his work: in fact, he&#8217;s used it to depict such icons as James Dean, David Bowie and Mickey Mouse. There&#8217;s many more examples of his work <a href="http://www.ottoschade.com/gallery/" target="_blank">on his website</a>. And for great pictures of this work being created, check out the <a href="http://50mmlondon.com/hoxton-based-artist-otto-schade-interview-featurette/" target="_blank">50mm London blog</a>.
