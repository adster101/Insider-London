In a latest blog post of ours, we listed Innovation Warehouse as one of[ 5 brilliant coworking spaces in London](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/coworking-spaces-london/). Insider London has sat down with its Operation and Community Manager, Bianca Anason, to find out more about this company. 

**How do you describe Innovation Warehouse and what you do?**

[Innovation Warehouse ](http://www.innovationwarehouse.org)is a coworking space for digital technology startups. We also provide numerous startup support activities through investment and mentoring programmes. Our space is full of different types and arrays of people; entrepreneurs, developers, mentors, investors etc, and we host events and meetups most evenings, which are a great way to meet like-minded individuals.

**What can and can't people expect when they come to you?**

They can expect to receive full support from our team and the odd pizza lunch every month or so. In terms of what they can’t expect, it would be for us to make their challenge easier. Their journey will still be rocky even with our help.

**What sets you apart from other organisations in your field?**

In reality, we are just another co-working space, but it’s just a matter of taste, which is differentiated by our community, and the overall feel of the space. We also have an in-office cat called Princess.

**If someone were to start up, what advice would you give them?**

We would advise them to thoroughly do their research, talk to people from within the industry to get a better understanding of the landscape and seek to better understand the customer and their wants and needs.

We would also advise start-up founders to be more realistic and be ready to pivot the business when and if necessary.

Listening is also part of the key. Take advice in a constructive manner and accept your possible lack of knowledge. This is all about building strong relationships and developing a network around you.

**Is there anything else that you want our readers to know?**

The biggest advantages of being part of Innovation Warehouse are the automatic enrolment into an open network of like-minded founders, experienced mentors, and potential investors as well as being in constant touch with the latest insights. We help them deal with challenges such convincing discerning investors, competing on a buyer’s market as well as finding the right talent.
