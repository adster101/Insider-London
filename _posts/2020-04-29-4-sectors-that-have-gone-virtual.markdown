As the lockdown continues, more and more sectors are exploring creative ways to retain their customer base or audience by going virtual as well as lift the public mood. At the same time, many people are trying to maintain favourite elements of their normal lifestyles and are interested in trying out new quirky experiences. Times are hard, but this week we explore the remarkable creativity of 4 sectors that have gone virtual. 


### 1.	Hospitality – the rise of the virtual pub

How are you spending your Friday night? Well alongside the growing popularity of [DIY pub quizzes](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52187500), you can now meet your friends in a virtual pub. Quick of the mark was [BrewDog](https://www.insiderlondon.com/blog/agile-marketing-brewdog/) who opened their online doors over a month ago with cook-a-longs mixology sessions and special delivery beer boxes for regulars to order in advance. Seven days ago Greene King launched [“The Lock Inn”](https://www.greeneking.co.uk/newsroom/latest-news/greene-king-launches-virtual-pub-the-lock-inn/) seven days ago, also offering quizzes, live acts and other activities.


### 2.	Education – learning doesn’t stop

Thousands of schools are [receiving support](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/schools-to-benefit-from-education-partnership-with-tech-giants) to use online education platforms and whether teaching toddlers or teenagers there are many platforms to choose from including Blackboard (favoured by many universities), G Suite, Microsoft Teams or just a teleconference call on Zoom. Nevertheless it’s not just school replacement, many citizens both young and old are using their new found time to [improve their prospects](https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/education-52447539)  or [learn new skills](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/22/lockdown-learning-10-great-ways-to-be-ready-for-your-next-holiday).


### 3. Museums & Heritage – journey through time and space

Museums and institutes are also getting in on the virtual action. Take a trip around the world from the comfort of your sofa with [virtual tours](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/23/10-of-the-worlds-best-virtual-museum-and-art-gallery-tours) of the Louvre, the Vatican Museum, London’s Natural History Museum, South Korea’s National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art and countless other examples. English Heritage and the Imperial War Museum are also [teaming up with children’s television presenters](https://advisor.museumsandheritage.com/news/museums-and-heritage-sector-unites-to-deliver-history-lessons-during-school-closures/) to bring history to life. 

### 4. Events – creativity carries on

From [film festivals ](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/27/entertainment/tribeca-youtube-we-are-one-film-festival/index.html)and [fashion week](https://www.elle.com/uk/fashion/a32218481/london-fashion-week-digital-gender-neutral/) to [club nights](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/the-best-clubs-to-party-at-online-041720) and National Theatre performances, we can livestream to our bandwidth's content. Like many sectors, times are hard for the events industry but creativity and tech is a winning combination. For the freelance artist in the age of social media then the world is your stage, and virtual tip jars are increasingly popular.
