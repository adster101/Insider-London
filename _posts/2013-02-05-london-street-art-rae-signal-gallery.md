**RAE &#8211; the Brooklyn street artist &#8211; is always playful, always fun; there’s a zest and sense of light-heartedness to his work. He’s even been quoted as saying he takes his cues from “the person who makes the misspelled signs at the corner deli, people who produce really bad local TV commercials [and] fashionable homeless men”. Not a bad starting point.**

And now he’s come to this side of the pond, not to mark our walls (or at least not entirely), but rather for an exhibition at Shoreditch&#8217;s [###### **[Alternative walking tours](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/ "Insider London alternative walking tours") > [Tour Blog](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/ "Insider London tours blog") > RAE exhibition**

Insider London went along to see what it was all about.<figure id="attachment_4200" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

The first thing that strikes you is that, as ever, there is a plethora of layers going on, both in terms of concept and material. RAE uses found and discarded items and creates the most fabulous _mélanges_. It’s the old adage that one man’s trash is another man’s you know what. This approach has always served him well so if it ain&#8217;t broke, don’t fix it, I guess. In fact, ‘if it _is_ broke, use it in your artwork’ would probably be more apt.

There’s a fantastic mouse creature that epitomises New York – I can imagine it selling peanuts at a Yankees baseball match in the 30s, or being a newspaper editor with a visor in [Citizen Kane](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyv19bg0scg "Citizen Kane trailer"). Its ears are made of jar lids, its head is part drill bit, there’s a gold necklace round the neck, and the neck itself looks like it’s constructed from a Hoover pipe (OK the chain’s not very Citizen Kane). Next to it is its scary elder brother – a sort of gremlin version of the peanut selling mouse.

Elsewhere bits of foil, mashed in bins, pens, paintbrushes and table tennis bats are all used in conjunction with er, paint. One piece that struck me was one in which there is a vague threat to ‘cap your ass’ whilst emblazoned also is ‘LOVE YOUR BUS DRIVER’. It’s the perfect city scene – mad violence and bus drivers stretched to breaking point. _London bus driver_ is the least appealing job I can think of and surely this plea could go down as one of the great urban mantras. Yet even if this type of city horror is what’s rolling over in RAE’s mind in the wee hours: again it’s playful and fun.

Childhood comes up a lot whether round the neck of Jesus’ confused great uncle (_see below_) or in the oft-occasioned smiling children.

There’s also a take on religious imagery- though here the angels look strung out rather than holier than thou.

And present throughout is RAE’s calling-card, a sort of robotic cyborg-pig creature. It looks menacing yet friendly at the same time, though in need of some dentistry. Or maybe it’s just me. Why don’t you go for yourself and let us know what you think? It’s free to get in though if you plan on purchasing some of the work on display take a big, _BIG_, briefcase of unmarked bills or else a credit card with plenty of leeway. The prices certainly made my eyes water!

And while you’re in the area, why not pop along on one of our [street art walking tours](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-graffiti-artists-walking-tours/ "Street Art walking tours") round East London? They certainly won’t break the bank….
