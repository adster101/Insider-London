If you're visiting London this Easter, you'll be spoilt for choice when deciding what to do. So here at Insider London we thought we'd give you a helping hand. We've come up with five things for you to do when in the city.

London is know for its quirky past, its unusual neighbourhoods and quite frankly weird stories. And our Quirky London walking tour, will give you a little insight into just that. You'll explore some well known sites such as Trafalgar Square, the Royal Opera House and Covent Garden, as well as some lesser known ones along the way. You can find out more information and can book a place on the tour [here](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/quirky-tour/).

Fingers crossed the weather in London stays nice over the break. And if it does, we suggest heading outside to see what [London's Royal Parks](https://www.royalparks.org.uk) have to offer. For those wishing to catch a glimpse of some local deer, Richmond Park is the natural choice. Or if you want to keep it a little more central, why not take a stroll around the beautiful Hyde Park? Where you can feed the swans in Serpentine Lake or visit the Diana, Princess of Wales Memorial Fountain.

All over London this Easter you'll find a number of fantastic Easter Eggs Hunts taking place, for all the family to take part in. The Museum of Brands is running a [Bunny Hop and Seek](http://www.museumofbrands.com/whats-on/exhibitions/bunny-hop-and-seek-for-easter-1-16-april.html) event, where children will have to find famous bunnies in their time tunnel in exchange for a chocolate prize. Or why not visit Hampton Court Palace for their [Lindt Gold Bunny Hunt](http://www.hrp.org.uk/hampton-court-palace/whats-on/easter-at-hampton-court-palace/#gs.iwrYxZw)?This is the first event of its kind at the home of Henry VIII and is a great way to inject some history in your Easter break to London.

Many people use the holidays to catch up on their shopping. And what better place to do so than London. Why not avoid the typical tourist hotspots and head somehwhere a little different? We've written a countdown article of our [top five quirky retail spaces in London](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/top-five-quirky-retail-spaces-in-london/), which we thing makes a great start to your shopping trip. And if you want to take a look at some wonderful Easter decorations, head to Fortnums & Mason. You may also want to pick up one of their beautifully designed chocolate eggs too.
