We&#8217;ve actually veered off the streets slightly for our street art picture this week. This image comes to us courtesy of Andy Winter, via our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/insiderlondon" target="_blank">facebook page</a>, who had the honour of getting his boat graffitied by two of London&#8217;s top artists: Sweet Toof and Paul Insect. The photo is taken at Old Ford Lock on the Regent&#8217;s Canal (<a href="/the-regents-canal-in-kings-cross-past-present-and-future/" target="_blank">where we took a walk last week</a>).

Sweet Toof has been especially busy recently: he&#8217;s also collaborated with Hackney Wick-based Bespoke Barware on a <a href="http://www.bespokebarware.com/news/sweet-toof-special-editions/" target="_blank">special edition range of cocktail mugs</a>. We&#8217;ll take one of the <a href="http://www.bespokebarware.com/shop/sweet-toof-skull-mug/" target="_blank">skull mugs</a> please.
