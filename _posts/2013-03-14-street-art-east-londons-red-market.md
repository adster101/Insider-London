Yesterday we were scouting around for some new finds for our <a href="/london-graffiti-artists-walking-tours/" target="_blank">Street Art Tour</a> and found that <a href="http://redmarketlondon.com/" target="_blank">The Red Market</a> was open&#8230; we wandered in and had a look around to find some gorgeous pieces. Here they are!

This artist had covered over all the street art on the wall and was painting her own massive piece. She was 2 weeks in to a 4 week project. The whole thing will be documented stop animation – we&#8217;ll post it here when it&#8217;s done.

A Roa piece which can be seen over the hoardings from the street, fully revealed up close. Love it

The back of the hoardings facing the Old Street junction. Amazing 3D skull.

Perspicere work – paint and thread – he&#8217;s our new favourite street artist

&nbsp;

Perspicere geometric threading vs Aida&#8217;s printing – love this too!
