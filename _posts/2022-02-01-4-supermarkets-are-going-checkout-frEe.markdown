Major food retailers in the UK have been accelerating their investment and implementation of AI technology in their checkout-free new stores all across the country.

### Amazon Fresh

**Amazon** has been trailblazing “contactless shops” with their own [Just Walk Out](https://justwalkout.com/) tech in the USA with **Amazon GO**, and being ahead of other large on-site retailers. **Amazon Fresh**, which [opened](https://www.shopfloorinsights.co.uk/storecheck-amazon-fresh) last year in London as their first physical store outside of the USA (if one discounts the fact that **Amazon** already owns the Whole Foods Market).  **Amazon Fresh** customers need to download the Amazon shop app, which provides a QR code which can be scanned to enter through the store barriers. Shoppers pick up their items and when they exit the store with them, their account is automatically charged. **Amazon** has since then opened further seven stores in London, and has plans to aggressively [expand](https://www.chargedretail.co.uk/2021/11/11/amazon-plans-to-open-200-cashierless-fresh-stores-to-catch-tesco-and-sainsburys/) with 200 new stores by 2024 to gain a significant footprint in the UK very competitive supermarket industry.

### Sainsbury’s

**Sainsbury’s** has had their own smart shopping app since 2016 for seamless quick shopping called [SmartShop](https://smartshop.sainsburys.co.uk/), however it’s not fully automated as you still need to scan the items yourself.  **Sainsbury's** has now partnered with **Amazon** to use the very same **Just Walk Out** technology after its first till-free store, which opened in 2019, was short-lived after complaints from shoppers who found the shopping experience difficult. Amazon tech in combination with **SmartShop** is now fully implemented at [Pick & Go](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2021/11/29/sainsburys-opens-smartshop-pick-and-go-store-at-holborn-circus-london) store, which opened last year in Holborn Circus in London: shoppers gain access with the app, specially positioned cameras detect which products customers have picked up, and get charged upon leaving.

### Tesco

**Tesco** being the largest supermarket chain in the UK is trying to catch up as this revolutionary technology is very likely going to change the retail landscape for years to come. **Tesco** teamed up with a tech start-up [Trigo](https://www.trigoretail.com/), which has their own AI tech for autonomous shopping, for their new [GetGo](https://www.tescoplc.com/news/2021/tesco-opens-new-checkout-free-store-getgo/) store in High Holborn London. To shop at **Tesco** **GetGo**, you’ll need to download the Tesco.com app and save your payment and Clubcard details in it. You scan in with the app at the entrance gates. **Trigo** AI tech fully automated system is following you around detecting what is removed from, or returned (even at wrong) shelfs; scan the app to leave and get charged.  


### Aldi

And not wanting to be left behind, the discount chain **Aldi** has teamed up with AI company [AiFi](https://aifi.com/) to develop its first autonomous grocery store [Shop&Go](https://retailtechinnovationhub.com/home/2022/1/18/aifi-tech-powers-new-aldi-uk-checkout-free-concept-store) in Greenwich, London.  **Aldi’s** experience goes a bit further as it also uses tech by a company called [Yoti](https://www.yoti.com/) to confirm customers’ identity on age restricted items such as alcohol using face recognition technology, reducing the need for manual checks by staff.
