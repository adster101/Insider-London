  <strong>This weekend wrap up warm and head down to London’s <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/">Natural History Museum</a>, as its grounds are turned into a fun-filled campsite. Vintage campervans, colourful tents and caravans will take over the ground around and within London’s famous <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit-us/darwin-centre-visitors/index.html">Darwin Centre</a>, which is devoted to scientific research. Inspired by the Museum scientists’ research field trips, The Campsite is the second offering in a 12-month series of innovative art and play events. The Museum has teamed up with theatre company Field Trip, offering visitors a variety of theatre, film, music and visual arts to take part in and enjoy.</strong>

  Now the event &#8211; which runs from 27<sup>th</sup> October – 2<sup>nd</sup> November &#8211; makes for the perfect visit to London. Entry is free, and as the school holidays approach, this could be the perfect way to entertain the kids. The activities include outdoor games such as giant Jenga, watching films in a campervan theatre and looking out for the lost camper roaming the museum.

  As you navigate the grounds of the museum, you’ll need to avoid being caught by the researchers who are wondering around though. If they do catch you, they’ll ‘prepare’ and tag you, ready to put you on display as the museum’s newest specimen. Did we mention that you’ll be displayed in a human-sized display case?

  But if you’re not quite as eager to jump in, don’t worry. You won’t be left bored as this unusual and out-of-season event is just as geared up for us grown-ups. You can watch a musical comedy on the work of Charles Darwin. Or how about experiencing a real Antarctic explorer’s tent? You can even become the new JK Rowling for the day and create a new nature story for the museum’s archives on a humble typewriter.

  Sarah Punshon, Programme Curator at the NHM says: “The Campsite is a brilliant chance for people to explore natural history in a fresh, playful way.and grown-ups can find out more about science and the natural world and have a lot of fun at the same time. We are working with some exciting young artists, so be prepared for a few surprises.”

  So as autumn firmly grips us, make the most of what may be one of the last chances to spend a day outside. Even if it&#8217;s just sitting on one of the comfy deckchairs with a warm mug of tea.
