Ever seen a man skateboarding in an orange peel? Ever roused a topless blonde taking a nap inside a vodka bottle? Ever walked past a food stall, selling hot dogs made of rats’ droppings? If you can answer “yes” to these questions, then don’t worry. You’re not cracking under the pressure of the busy city life and subsequently hallucinating. You haven’t had anything dodgy slipped into your drink from the night before. Chances are, you’ve stumbled upon a **Slinkachu**.<figure id="attachment_2609" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

As magical as the city might be, you wouldn’t be a stranger to piles of litter, miserable weather and people too lazy to clean up after their pets. Instead of gagging, however, Slinkachu’s Little People Project has put a beautiful spin on crap situations throughout the world since 2006. Through his site-specific installations, he directly responds to and manipulates otherwise mundane surroundings, effectively challenging our interaction with the space.<figure id="attachment_2612" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

What begins as a pile of cigarette butts floating in a puddle becomes a womens&#8217; loggers leap competition. The remains of a greasy takeaway evolve into a toxic landslide, sweeping away the city within its silver foil confines. Your everyday snail gets promoted to Inner City Snail &#8211; a “slow-moving street art project” &#8211; brightening up backstreets and alleyways. This street artist and photographer stages the city’s rubbish, allowing us to create our own narratives for his modified train-set figures. Your average Londoner might not notice the happenings of the city’s most intimate nooks and crannies but Slinkachu breathes life into the non-place.<figure id="attachment_2613" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
