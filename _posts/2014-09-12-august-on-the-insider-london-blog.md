Well, we&#8217;re not quite sure how it happened but apparently it&#8217;s already September. We&#8217;ve bought ourselves a new notebook and pencil in readiness for the excitement of autumn in London but, before we start with that, let&#8217;s celebrate some of the best bits of August.

Did you catch anything of <a href="/london-festival-of-architecture-2014-the-best-bits/" target="_blank">the Festival of Architecture</a>? Fear not if you missed it, as we featured a round-up of the best bits on the blog. London&#8217;s currently gearing up for the Design Festival too. There&#8217;s more to come on the site about that but, in the meantime, you can check out <a href="http://www.londondesignfestival.com/" target="_blank">the official LDF site here</a>.

Also just opened is a display about the <a href="/mapping-london/" target="_blank">mapping of Londo</a>n, featuring this incredible 16th-century map. You&#8217;ll need to head down to the Science Museum too, before the 14 September, for <a href="/the-rubbish-collection-at-the-science-museum/">an exhibition which is, literally, rubbish</a>.

We took <a href="/the-regents-canal-in-kings-cross-past-present-and-future/" target="_blank">a walk along the Regent&#8217;s Canal </a>to consider its past, present and future. Next time we go for a wander, we&#8217;ll be taking a copy of Melissa Wood&#8217;s CitySketch London, a new book that encourages you to get doodling around the capital. You can read <a href="/melissa-wood-illustrator-citysketch-london/" target="_blank">our interview with Melissa here</a>.

This <a href="/smiley-otto-schade-street-art-london-brick-lane/" target="_blank">Smiley by Otto Schade</a> is one of our favourite bits of street art featured this month: check back <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tag/street-art-picture-of-the-week/" target="_blank">each Wednesday</a> for a new image. We also considered the thorny issue of <a href="/streetwise-artful-marketing/" target="_blank">how street artists market themselves</a>. By selling their work are they selling out? Let us know what you think.
