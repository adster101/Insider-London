  <strong>Shoreditch has in recent years been overshadowed by its near neighbours. But if you&#8217;re sick of Dalston and fancy an after work drink, an interesting place to take a date or a full blown night out, why not give Shoreditch another chance? This part of London is packed with pubs and bars, and still has an enviable offering for the urban explorer inside us who is striving to find something different and less over-subscribed.</strong>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  We&#8217;ve put together a list (in no particular order) of 7 Shoreditch bars and pubs which we think offer something different, and are a little off the beaten track. Perfect if you want to mix up your night out, and have your favourite tipple mixed somewhere new.

  A cool little bar, that quite simply makes excellent cocktails. The opulent surroundings make for a  relaxing and luxurious stay, without making you feel like you&#8217;ve stumbled into an invite-only private party. The ever-expanding space keeps on surprising, and would be perfect for a first date, or a girly get together.

<p style="text-align: justify">
  This Shoreditch institution is a great place to drink, with its low purple seats, never-ending bar and lively atmosphere. The drinks menu has won many awards, and boasts a marmite-inspired drink, the &#8216;Marmageddon&#8217;. But the fun really starts in the back room members club &#8216;Jubjub&#8217;. Housed behind a heavy wardrobe door, the charming room is a must. Membership is awarded for appreciation of the drinks, not cash. So bribing the bartender won&#8217;t work.

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Opened last year, this basement bar from the same guys behind <a href="http://www.purl-london.com/">Purl</a>, is the first new gin palace to open in London for at least a century. The decor is Victoriana &#8211; so think dark wood, comfy leather sofas and that kind of old world ambient light. The menu is littered with intriguing twists on old classics, and it pays off to be adventurous.

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  For a little slice of Prohibition-era Manhattan, head down City Road to this stylish basement speakeasy. With an excellent cocktail list, expertly executed by a team of talented bartenders, Nightjar is the perfect place to start an evening. The soundtrack of jazz and blues will definitely help the alcohol slip down, and the weekends see the venue put on a range of live events.

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Stepping into Lounge Bohemia, is like entering 1960&#8217;s Eastern Europe. Walking down the narrow corridor and metal staircase, into the basement bar below, really is a journey. The bar is TINY and only holds maybe 40 people. You need to book directly with the owner, Paul, and there is a strict no office-wear policy. Not for everyone, but the drinks are good and the atmosphere nice, it makes a change to all get a seat due to the no-standing policy.

  <span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Commercial Tavern</strong></span>
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
  A re-take of a traditional East End boozer, the Commercial Tavern is housed in a grand Victorian building, that juts out into the street. Inside is a modern take, with Polaroids and magazine covers adorning the walls. The bar offers a good selection of beers as well as wine and spirits. The place does gets busy towards the weekend, and doesn&#8217;t open until 5pm most days.

<p style="text-align: justify">
  Not much bigger than your front room, Casita is one of the real hidden gems in Shoreditch. Offering something different from other Shoreditch bars, this little Mexican shack is great for beer or cocktails, but be warned, you&#8217;re expected to try their speciality shot, Tequila Con Verdita. Or else. Because of its size, expect to stand, but the amazingly friendly atmosphere makes up for it, aided by a crowd of actual locals. Gets very busy towards the end of the week.
