For years, as it’s only acceptable mode of investment, the Japanese tech conglomerate - Softbank - pursued the concept of propelling Unicorns into global dominance via hyper-growth. In short Softbank championed the era of growth at all costs. Now, in 2020, after a number of breathtaking failures could this, some would say, “reckless” approach to investing be over?

Alongside the Uber IPO disaster and the train-wreck of WeWork’s failed IPO last quarter saw Softbank’s profits nosedive 99%.

Add to this Softbank’s overreach with [accusations of Indian disruptor OYO](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/how-oyo-landed-in-real-problems-due-to-softbanks-dramatic-overreach-2181901) and clearly investors must be shaking their heads in disbelief.
[Uber Technology’s ’s IPO fell massively short of its $100 billion valuation](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/uber-ipo-5-things-you-need-to-know-about-potentially-the-biggest-ipo-in-years-2019-04-12) whilst the We Company (the owners of WeWork) is now an infamous example of the dangers of fast-growth and overvaluations. The [scandals of its founder](https://www.wsj.com/articles/weworks-ceo-makes-millions-as-landlord-to-wework-11547640000) and [company culture](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17969190/wework-lawsuit-sexual-assault-harassment-retaliation) overshadowed its [overambitious expansions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/12/26/wework-hits-brakes-expansion-botched-float/) but all played a part in the flop. The Wall Street Journal published an aptly titled expose on the assessment of WeWorks valuation: “a $20 Billion dollar start-up fuelled by Silicon Valley pixie dust”. 

With recent Softbank’s profits falling by 99% and its write down investment in WeWork of $4.6bn we ask what’s next for Softbank?

A supposed master of long-term visioning (cue [the famous “300 years plan”](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/19/masayoshi-son-genius-or-insane-maybe-neither.html) ), for Masayoshi Son this should therefore be just a small bump in a very long road. 

Despite issues with the Vision 1 fund, Vision 2 is being launched along similar principles, to financially back [“the most superior companies at the time in the information industry”](https://group.softbank/en/corp/about/philosophy/vision/ ). Billions are being poured into [new investments](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/02/18/softbank-launches-second-vision-fund-with-25-billion-investment-report/#503e18f12a88) and Softbank reportedly plans to [borrow a further $4.5 billion](https://in.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-softbank/softbank-to-borrow-up-to-4-5-billion-using-domestic-telcos-shares-as-collateral-idINKBN20D0R1).

One company benefitting from the second round, Vision 2 fund, is Karius, who have raised £165 million. This investment [chimes well with Softbank’s history of healthcare speculation](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-karius-funding/softbank-leads-165-million-capital-boost-for-liquid-biopsy-firm-karius-idUSKCN20I155), Karius are US-firm marketing simple blood-tests for infections that are difficult to diagnose.

Another headliner is the [£100 million potential investment in Behavox](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-24/softbank-fund-invests-100-million-in-compliance-software-firm). Behavox develops compliance and employee-monitoring software for financial firms. The concept is in using machine-learning and advanced analytics to monitor employees’ behaviour. This, Behavox claim, can help provide early detection of [bribery, rogue trading, misuse of expenses and more](https://www.cityam.com/softbank-set-to-invest-100m-in-ai-startup-behavox/).

**What next for Softbank?** The world still has an estimated 450 Unicorns; many pitching something’s that doesn’t exist yet, so clearly a lot of potential investment still to consider for Softbank. But after the Wework implosion and the spate of downed valued IPOs resulting in tumbling profits and massive write-offs, surely the time where investors have shown a willingness to suspend their disbelief, is over? Time will tell.
