If you’re going on guided walks in London in the near future, make sure you ask your tour guide to take you to Borough Market if there’s time, as this is one of the absolute [must-do attractions that the Big Smoke has to offer](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/).

Did you know that the market itself has been around in one form or another [for an impressive 1,000 years or so](http://boroughmarket.org.uk/)? It’s thought that it can be dated as far back as 1014, which is certainly not to be sneezed at – and it’s still going strong!

It’s certainly seen some tough times (such as almost being killed off by the unstoppable growth of supermarkets in the 70s), but the serious popularity of artisan foods these days has helped bring the market back – and in a big way.

Now, it’s the most famous market in the whole of the UK and you absolutely have to go to it at least once in your lifetime… as long as you’ve got a hearty appetite, that is. If you can imagine it, then you’re sure to find it here, whether it’s all sorts of different and interesting cheeses, incredible chocolates, handmade cakes and pastries, kitchen tools, tableware, wine, charcuterie… the list is basically endless.

It’s also the perfect place to taste-test some street food from all over the world. Give authentic Ethiopian dishes a go, see if kid goat meat floats your boat or try some Egyptian street food for the first time. Whatever you fancy doing, Borough Market is the place to give it all a go.
