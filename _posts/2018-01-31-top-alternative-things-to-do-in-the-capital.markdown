When you think of things to do in London, your first thoughts are probably about the museums, galleries and historic sights that line the city’s streets and, while these are great things to see and do while you’re in the capital, there are some alternatives out there too.

The [Evening Standard](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/attractions/7-extreme-activities-you-didn-t-know-you-could-try-in-london-a3741441.html) recently highlighted a number of “extreme activities” that you might be surprised to find on offer in London.

One that definitely ticks the extreme box is axe throwing, which is available at Whistle Punk in Vauxhall. Under the watchful eye of an experienced instructor, you’ll learn the finer points of axe throwing and have a chance to hurl them at targets.

Another activity that’s extreme in more ways than one is the ice climbing wall that can be found in Covent Garden. Vertical Chill is an indoor ice climbing wall where the temperature can drop to a chilly -12 degrees C and you have eight metres of an ice face to climb, under the supervision of an instructor of course.

If you don’t mind the cold, you might also find a different take on go-karting is a good way to spend an afternoon in London. Head to Queens for a chance to have a go at ice karting - it’s exactly what you’re imagining.

Even if you live in London or visit frequently, there are always areas you’re less familiar with, or hidden attractions and sights that you might not have stumbled across. If you’re looking for something different, but a little less extreme, to do with your free time then a ghost tour in London is a great option.
