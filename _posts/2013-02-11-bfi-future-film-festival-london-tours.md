**Dear all Young Budding Film-Makers and Fervent Film Fanatics,**
  
**It is Insider London&#8217;s utmost pleasure to inform you that, on the weekend of the sixteenth of February, the [BFI](http://www.bfi.org.uk/ "BFI") is bringing you a veritable playground of events tailored to thrust your film-making dreams into an excited, passionate flurry.** **The <a title="Future Film Festival" href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/future-film-festival?menu_id=FB769377-8118-4895-B500-9B47D599C1B4&sToken=1%2C7f359459%2C5112914b%2C62719054-0E9B-42FB-9F0F-9D31E1CAAB8D%2CfzX2hJExiKEwAv4CtJY060fCG%2Bo%3D" target="_blank">Future Film Festival</a> is back for it&#8217;s 6th year running, and they reckon it&#8217;s their best one yet. Looking at the line-up, I&#8217;d be inclined to believe them.

****Open to all those lucky enough to be aged 15-25, the weekend is a rip-roaring adventure through short film screenings, workshops and talks on a myriad of film-making know-how, and plenty of chances for valuable discussion and networking opportunities.

Day one **(Saturday 16th)** of the festival will focus on fictional storytelling. As well as a selection of amazing short films by talented new directors, there will be a screening of 20-year-­old, envy-inducing director Rob Savage&#8217;s BIFA-award winning debut feature &#8216;Strings&#8217;, and Sally El Hosaini&#8217;s multi-award winning first feature film &#8216;My Brother the Devil&#8217;. Talks include a session on collective film-making with IdeasTap, writing your first screenplay with The Script Factory, finding the dream job you didn&#8217;t know existed in the film world, and the low-down on comedy acting.

Day two (**Sunday 17th)** will focus on Animation, exploring the worlds of Claymation, Anime, 3D and more, with masterclasses, workshops and a screening of Sam Fell&#8217;s &#8216;ParaNorman&#8217;, led by a host of animation experts and panellists.

Day three (**Monday the 18th)** sets its sights on Documentary film making, packed with practical insights and information for budding documentary and factual filmmakers. Workshops will help participants gain the confidence to master the art of interviewing as well as sessions on pitching and funding, and choosing your subject. To close the Festival, BFI Southbank will welcome genre-breaking director Penny Woolcock, who will be discussing her acclaimed new film &#8216;One Mile Away&#8217;.

Festival programmer Noel Goodwin told me just how excited he is about the festival _(very)_, and why he thinks this is the most promising year so far: _&#8220;There&#8217;s never been a better time to get into filmmaking. Equipment and software is relatively cheap and accessible, as are online resources. What&#8217;s unique about the Future Film Festival is that our programme is dominated by practical workshops, masterclasses and opportunities to hear from, speak to and access film industry talent. We want to see the (British) film industry flourish by helping to encourage and support a diverse spectrum of creative, passionate young filmmakers to take the next step in their journey into film.&#8221;  _

You&#8217;ve convinced me, Noel! _
  
_ I&#8217;ll be going, and with half a film script sat in my room that&#8217;s- ahem- somewhat gathering dust, hoping to revive my film-making spirit enough to perhaps one day even finish it&#8230;? I may be getting a little carried away there, but if this weekend hasn&#8217;t got what it takes, nothing has. I&#8217;ll see you there, pen and paper in hand, ready to ingest some top notch film industry know-how.

You can buy your tickets for the BFI Future Film Festival <a href="https://whatson.bfi.org.uk/Online/default.asp?doWork::WScontent::loadArticle=Load&BOparam::WScontent::loadArticle::article_id=5072F689-1A46-4E7D-986C-B35E15AFC378" target="_blank">here</a>, and at £10 for 15-18 year olds, and £20 for 19-25 year olds for the whole weekend, it&#8217;s pretty much the best pocket money/beer money you&#8217;ll spend all year!
