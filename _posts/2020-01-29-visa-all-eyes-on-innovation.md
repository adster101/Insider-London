### Visa in History

When Bank of America launched the first consumer credit card (BankAmericard), the seeds were sown for [Visa](https://www.visa.co.uk/about-visa/our_business/history-of-visa.html). In 1958 this was the first card accepted by large numbers of merchants and ignited a cashless revolution that would change consumer behaviour forever. In the late 60s, several other banks joined together to compete and launched the MasterCharge card.

As the banks battled for market domination, a new entity was formed (National Americard  Inc – renamed Visa International in 1976) with [Dee Hock](https://www.fastcompany.com/27333/trillion-dollar-vision-dee-hock) at the helm. Among many other changes made under his leadership the original system of the merchant calling up to check the consumer’s credit balance was replaced. In 1973 the system became the first electronic authorisation system.
Fast-forward to the twenty-first century and 2008 saw Visa become the [largest initial public offering in history](https://www.visa.co.uk/about-visa/our_business/history-of-visa.html). Nevertheless, like all big corporates, Visa knows that to keep ahead the answer lies in one word: innovation.
