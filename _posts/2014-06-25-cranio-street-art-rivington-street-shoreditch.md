With the world&#8217;s eyes on Brazil at the moment, who better to feature as our street art picture of the week than Cranio? Born in Sao Paulo, Cranio developed his distinctive blue &#8216;Indians&#8217; as a way of depicting the indigenous people of Brazil. His work frequently has a political edge: you can see an example of his anti-World Cup street art <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2014/jun/09/brazils-anti-world-cup-street-art-in-pictures" target="_blank">here</a>. This photograph was taken on Rivington Street in Shoreditch, London, near Cargo.
