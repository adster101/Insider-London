###### [Essential London Walking Tours](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/ "Insider London Walking Tours") > [Tour Blog](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/ "Insider London Blog") > Best London Pub Quizzes

**As activities in London go, testing your brainpower as a stranger in a garish jacket pummels you with tantalising nuggets is up there with the best of them. Here, we’ve picked the best pub quizzes London has to offer. But be warned, this is not only about mental muscle…**

**POW takes no prisoners**

****Oft-regarded as the toughest pub quiz in London, the Prince of Wales in leafy Highgate is run by not only one quizmaster but a dedicated team of SIX! They have honed their skill at twisting your melon and challenging your bank of useless but priceless information.

Tuesdays, Prince of Wales, 53 Highgate High Street, N6

**Don’t get fruity!**

****Kentish Town’s The Pineapple might have a thing to say about the Princes of Wales’ claims. Though with Roger Lloyd Pack (aka Trigger) in the crowd, you may have your doubts.

Mondays, The Pineapple, 51 Leverton Street NW5 2NX<figure id="attachment_3319" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

**I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles**

****At the Queen’s Head in Islington prepare yourself for an unconventional evening. As if the spectre of seeing the ghost of a young child running ahead of you up the stairs isn’t enough, try out this bonkers quiz. Part mental  challenge, part primary school fun, ‘Martin’ will have you painting faces and blowing on a Kazoo.

<span style="font-size: small;">Tuesdays, The Old Queen&#8217;s Head, 44 Essex Road, London, N1 8LN</span>

**Darling, Darling, _I’ll _answer this**

This quiz does exactly what it says on the tin. The Marksman’s _A Fashionable Pub Quiz_ in Shoreditch concerns design, celebrity and music. Anyone who’s been to Bestival  or Shoreditch House may well have already got mucky with the creative round!

Mondays, The Marksman, 254 Hackney Rd, London, E2 7SJ

**Talk to the hand**

If the Marksman’s effort doesn’t go far enough for you, try the popbitch quiz. You might win gig tickets, you might win a dildo. Either way, this is gonna be naughty. Now back at its spiritual home, Soho&#8217;s The Player.

Mondays, The Player, 8 Broadwick Street  Soho  W1F 8HN<figure id="attachment_3321" style="width: 569px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

**Chinstroking rhythms**

****For the dedicated music buff, look no further than The Lexington’s Monday night quiz run by Rough Trade. But leave your Rihannas and your Chezzas at the door cos this is serious! (Beards optional).

Mondays, The Lexington, 96-98 Pentonville Road, London, N1 9JB

**Cryptic & Historical**

The last time we went to the Hat & Tun&#8217;s Monday night quiz we came a cropper over the first Red Nose Day. You need to know your charity events from your _Russian National Disasters_ that&#8217;s for sure! And watch out for Christopher Walken. You have been warned&#8230;.

Mondays, Hat & Tun, 3 Hatton Wall, London, EC1N 8HX
