As we hurtle towards the end of the year, let&#8217;s take a moment to pause and remind ourselves of some of the things we enjoyed over November.

We pride ourselves on taking something of a closer look at what&#8217;s going on London&#8217;s street &#8211; although perhaps not quite as close as the boy pictured above. He&#8217;s intrigued &#8211; as we were &#8211; by one of the figures from the fantastic <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/03/fine-art-as-street-art-the-outings-project/" target="_blank">Outings Project</a>, which takes fine art from the galleries and onto the streets. <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/03/fine-art-as-street-art-the-outings-project/" target="_blank">Find out more here</a>.

Some of our other street art spots this month have included <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/26/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-jim-probs-vision-and-the-end-of-the-line-collective/" target="_blank">Jim &#8216;Probs&#8217; Vision</a>, <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/12/art-is-trash-london-street-art/" target="_blank">Art is Tra$h</a>, <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/05/street-art-picture-of-the-week-cupids-hit-squad-whitecross-street-london-ec1/" target="_blank">DS</a>Â and <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/19/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-bicicletas-sem-freios-and-cranio/" target="_blank">Biciletas Sem Freios</a>.

Someone else making his home around London is Paddington: there are 50 of these bears loose around London at the moment. More information on <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/28/the-paddington-trail/" target="_blank">how to find them here</a>.

From bears to elephants &#8211; we rounded up <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/21/insider-londons-best-of-the-london-underground-and-tube/" target="_blank">our favourite posts about the London Underground</a>. That includes this great use of the Underground map by <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/21/insider-londons-best-of-the-london-underground-and-tube/" target="_blank">Paul Middlewick</a>. And, while we&#8217;re still Underground, we found out more about the <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/14/mail-rail-letters-on-the-underground/" target="_blank">Mail Rail</a>, including plans to open a stretch to the public, here.

We shared some stunning maps and infographics from new book, <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/10/london-the-information-project-infographics-that-will-change-the-way-you-view-the-city/" target="_blank">London: The Information Project</a>. This map shows the most photographed areas of the city, according to Flickr at least.

And, finally, we played a game of top trumps with <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2014/11/17/the-towers-of-london/" target="_blank">some of London&#8217;s historic tall buildings</a>.
