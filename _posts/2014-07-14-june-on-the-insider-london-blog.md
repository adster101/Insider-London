June was a busy month at Insider London. We&#8217;ve been exploring lesser known corners of the city, speaking to people changing the capital in unique ways and getting to grips with London&#8217;s ever evolving skyline. Here&#8217;s what you may have missed.

People may talk about &#8216;sustainable architecture&#8217; a lot, but its definition can be quite hard to pin down. Thankfully for us, Tom answers the question <a href="/what-is-sustainable-architecture/" target="_blank">&#8216;What is sustainable architecture?&#8217; here</a>. That blog post may also help answer another question: &#8216;How green is your London hotel?&#8217; We compare <a href="/london-green-hotels/" target="_blank">five different examples here</a>.

</p>

On the subject of greener architecture, we also took a look at five of <a href="/london-rooftop-gardens/" target="_blank">London&#8217;s hidden green rooftop</a>s, and spoke to <a href="/urban-bees-interview/" target="_blank">Urban Bees</a>, who encourage beekeeping around the capital.

Urban Bees do a lot of work at the Camley Street nature park near King&#8217;s Cross. Insider London are really interested in all the changes going on around King&#8217;s Cross at the moment (you may have noticed our <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/kings-cross-innovation-tour/" target="_blank">Kings Cross regeneration tour</a>), and we spoke to another person changing the environment around King&#8217;s Cross &#8211; although in a slightly different way. Petra Barran set up KERB, a mobile street food market that aims to change how people enjoy food in the city, and which has been hugely influential in the way people view King&#8217;s Cross. <a href="/petra-barran-kerb-interview/" target="_blank">Find out more about her experiences and plans for the future here</a>.

Finally, we always love exploring London&#8217;s street art and graffiti and this month certainly was no different. Nick took a look at the <a href="/the-many-forms-of-street-art/" target="_blank">many forms of street art</a> and also blogged about the implications of the <a href="/banksy-london-street-art/" target="_blank">Banksy sale at Sotheby&#8217;s</a>. Don&#8217;t forget to check back every week, when we pick out a <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/?s=street+art+picture" target="_blank">different street art picture to enjoy</a>. <span style="color: #4d4d4d;">Got a great picture of London’s Street Art you’d like to share with us? Email </span><a id="yui_3_16_0_1_1402043296792_83087" style="color: #196ad4;" href="mailto:frances@insider-london.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" shape="rect">frances@insider-london.co.uk</a><span style="color: #4d4d4d;"> with more details: we&#8217;d love to feature it on our blog. </span>
