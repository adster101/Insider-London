This impressive piece of lettering is the work of Ben Eine, well-known for his alphabetical enhancements of walls and shutters around London, the UK and now the world. It reads &#8220;Extortionists&#8221;, a partner piece to a work called &#8220;Protagonists&#8221; on the other side of Ebor Street. Eine has recently been in the news thanks to his <a href="http://inspiringcity.com/2014/06/30/street-artist-ben-eine-creates-the-review-a-massive-mural-in-the-heart-of-londons-olympic-park/" target="_blank">new mural for London&#8217;s Olympic Park</a>.

You need to walk along these murals to experience them in their full glory &#8211; emphasising that the best place to see street art is always out in the streets (or at least outside, in the case of the Olympic Park).
