Office parties, whether they're celebrating Christmas, winter or the break away from work, should be special occasions that everyone enjoys. But sometimes you can get stuck organising the same thing you've done every year for the last five years. Well this year can be different. Why not turn your office party into an exciting walking tour of London? We offer [bespoke walking tours](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/special-occasions/) for large groups, which is perfect for this type of celebration.  
 
All of our tours can be booked privately, allowing you and your work colleagues a more tailored, unique experience, that fits your needs and interests. From past experience booking group tours we can recommend that our [London Underground and Tube](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/london-underground-and-tube-tour/) tour, [History of Drinking and Pubs](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/history-of-drinking-and-pubs/) tour and our [Death and Debauchery](www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/the-death-and-debauchery-tour/) tour, are especially popular for Christmas office parties.  
 
With the London Underground and Tube tour you'll learn about the 150 years worth of tube history in just two hours, whilst visiting both old and new stations across the city. Or if you would prefer to remain above ground we have either the History of Drinking and Pubs tour or our Death and Debauchery tour. Both will allow you to enjoy a drink in London's historic drinking spots and learn about the history behind some of England's oldest drinking establishments. 
 
These tours are not only popular with office parties, they're also perfect for this time of year. We know the idea of walking around London for almost two hours in the winter weather is not appealing to many people, that's why these tours take place mostly inside. You'll spend most of your time inside pubs or underground (depending on which tour you choose) and will only spend a little time outside walking from venue to venue.
