This year, Londoners are delighted to host the capital’s very first mural festival! Some see this as clear evidence street art has well and truly moved from the fringe into the mainstream, and perhaps now is the perfect time. Key organiser of the festival, Lee Bofkin, CEO of Global Street Art has stated that street art is “a non-contact sport” created and viewed outdoors. Press reports agree that the festival offers [“accessible art in the time of social distancing”](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/14/accessible-and-social-distanced-london-mural-festival-takes-street-art-mainstream).

Furthermore, Camille Walala – the iconic London-based artist known for her funky “tribal pop” style has stated [“with so many things being cancelled and postponed, I am very happy to see the first London Mural Festival is still going ahead.”](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/london-mural-festival-a4542006.html). Perhaps unsurprisingly, many pieces included in the festival explore the events and public atmosphere of 2020 such as Ben Eine & Rachel Joy’s Leyton mural [“Stronger Together”](https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/arts/london-mural-festival-a4542006.html).

Camille Walala, Ben Eine & Rachel Joy Price are not the only big names on the bill. This year’s festival also counts D*face, Mr Cenz and Dale Grimshaw among contributors. In total, more than 150 artists are coming to leave their mark, from as far afield as Colombia, Japan and Australia. The exact number of murals is still unclear with reports ranging from 50 to 150 and the organisers mysteriously updating their [online map](https://www.londonmuralfestival.com/map) on a weekly basis until all murals are complete. Spots have been arranged all over London from Wembley to Canary Wharf. 
 
The festival draws to a close with an exciting event from 3rd-4th October – a 100-artist hoarding jam (where 100 artists will all create a giant mural together) in the International Quarter of the Olympic Park, Stratford. This extraordinary feature will stretch over 500m and bring the festival to a suitably colourful close.



### “Culture and the arts are synonymous with London and it’s the number one reason that visitors come here. The London Mural Festival is a fantastic innovative addition to our cultural landscape and really puts London in the spotlight as a dynamic and creative city.”
