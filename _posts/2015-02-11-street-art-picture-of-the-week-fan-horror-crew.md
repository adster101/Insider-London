This week&#8217;s street art picture is the work of Fan of the UK&#8217;s Horror Crew. We love these balloon animals &#8211; if only our animal sculpting skills were so good!

There&#8217;s always a playful element to their work &#8211; other pieces includeÂ Liquorice allsorts and the like. <a href="http://jenikya.com/blog/2013/09/street-art-fan-horror-crew.html" target="_blank">You can see some more examples here</a>.

This was spotted in September last year in the alleyway between London&#8217;s Brick Lane and Allen Gardens, a great spot for checking out new work (<a href="/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-are-you-ready-for-your-close-up/" target="_blank">see a couple more finds here</a>). And, for more street art, come and join one of our <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-graffiti-artists-walking-tours/" target="_blank">London street art and graffiti walking tours</a> &#8211; always something new to be discovered!
