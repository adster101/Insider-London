### > “A recent survey showed two thirds of employers look for graduates with relevant work experience because it helps them prepare for work and develop general business awareness. Importantly, one third of employers felt that applicants did not have a satisfactory level of knowledge about their chosen career or job.” [(UCAS, 2017)](https://www.ucas.com/connect/blogs/work-experience-important) 

For some graduates, applying for jobs can feel like an endless cycle – you need experience to get a job, but to get that experience you need a job….

So what’s the solution? 

An internship. Not only an internship that shows the candidate’s commitment on their CV, but an internship that they can comfortably expand on in an interview, explaining how they honed certain skills and deepened their knowledge of the industry. An internship that gives them the confidence to talk the talk and walk the walk as they make their first step onto the careers ladder. 

Internships allow candidates to show themselves and future employers that this is the career for them. Through real-world experience interns can find out if it’s a career path they would genuinely enjoy and that they are personally suited to. It’s a vital opportunity to explore an industry and reduce the chances of a panicked career change a few months into their first job! 
[93% of UK business leaders](https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/work-experience_uk_5a229aafe4b0545e64bf938e) stated they want compulsory work experience re-introduced in schools. By seeking out an internship, students demonstrate genuine interest in the sector, show their work ethic and set themselves apart from the competition.

With an internship, students can build confidence interacting with real industry professionals and get out of their usual comfort zone of classmates and professors. Soft skills like teamwork, communication and time management are often important in a university setting – but can present themselves very differently in the working environment.
