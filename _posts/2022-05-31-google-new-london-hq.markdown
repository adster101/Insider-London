This week we have revisited King's Cross to check on the progress of the new Google building, which will become its headquarters. The building, known as KGX1, will combine with Google’s existing offices at 6 Pancras Square and should be completed by 2024.

#### Google HQ

In 2018 Google started building its new “landscraper” London headquarters in King’s Cross. The structure, designed by [Bjarke Ingel Group](https://big.dk/#projects) and [Heatherwick Studio](https://www.heatherwick.com/), will be longer than The Shard is tall at 312 metres, and will be equipped with a wellness centre, plenty of bike parking, and a roof garden planted with gooseberry and sage. 

The building is not only going to be for the Google employees, but alongside the individual retail units, a market hall will offer a launchpad for small businesses. At the same time, a community, education and event space will host a changing programme of events all year round.

###### ‘We want the spaces and experiences we offer to create opportunity for local people and businesses and contribute to the culture of entrepreneurship and vibrancy of the area’
-Ronan Harris, Vice President and MD, Google UK & Ireland

Once completed, it will bring Google’s total number of offices in the area to three.
