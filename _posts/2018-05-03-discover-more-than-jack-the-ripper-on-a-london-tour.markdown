There’s no denying that the great city of London is full of interesting (and sometimes quite horrible) stories… there’s so much history and tradition in the metropolis that you could spend your entire life exploring it and still not know all there is to know. 

By signing yourself up to walking tour, you can give yourself a head start, for example on one of the many [Jack the Ripper tours of London](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/famous-ghosts-and-infamous-murders/). If you already know about him, but you want to learn more spine-chilling stories around ghosts and murderers, check out our Famous Ghosts and Infamous Murders tour! If you’re new to the Ripper, though, read on.

Way back when in 1888, Whitechapel in London was home to five horrendous murders of prostitutes, with the killer dubbed Jack the Ripper. All the women killed except for one were horribly mutilated.

Over the years, speculation has been rife as [to the identity of the killer](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-43955441), but he was never caught. Some believe that he or she may have been a butcher or doctor, based on the evidence of mutilations and weapons used – which may have been an indication of a knowledge of human anatomy.
There are even a few theories bandying about linking Prince Albert Victor, Queen Victoria’s grandson, to the murders… although there’s not much evidence out there to support this.

You can find out more about famous murderers of London on Insider London’s ghost tour. This takes place at night and will take you around some of the streets where ghosts can be found, squeezing through one of the city’s narrowest alleyways, visiting leper hospitals and plague pits, and learning more, maybe even about the murder mystery that is Jack the Ripper.
