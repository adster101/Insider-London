**So it&#8217;s definitely really cold outside at the moment. And I don&#8217;t know about you, but I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve been out raving much of late, due to a strong desire to just sit in bed and do absolutely nothing. What I _have_ done, however, is sit on a rooftop for several hours, at night, having dinner.** **Not as barmy as it sounds, my friends: for this was a night at Forza Win(ter), and it was a rooftop full of hot cocktails, blankets, music, incredible food, a whole load of very happy, chatting (and singing) people and, most importantly- big-ass heaters.**

Forza Wint(ter) is the wintry sibling of Forza Win, a rooftop pop-up pizza restaurant that kicked up a fuss this summer on the supper-club scene. _Fonduta_ is the word on the street this season, however, (_not_ to be mistaken for _Fondue,_ albeit v. similar), with Sebastian (Bash) Redford and his team of chefs whipping up bowls of delicious molten cheese and all sorts of wonderful dishes of dippy food-stuffs. A &#8220;Buttered Rum&#8221;, served to us by resident musician-turned-waiter for the evening Josh, was a wonderful warming greeting in a glass, of Harry Potter-ish magic. Once seated at large, round, conversation-making tables, big steaming pots of creamy Fonduta were placed ceremoniously in the centre, and the dipping commenced!

Our cheesy extravaganza featured beautiful slices of melt-in-the-mouth butternut squash, hearty wedges of sour dough and hackney cobbler, roasted tomatoes, paprika-fried cauliflower (who knew cauliflower could be so enticing?), and lovely parsnips; all ready to be dipped into bowls of hot melty greatness from the pot that was never empty. I must note that my account is vegetarian-biased: there was also ham- slow cooked for four hours- which my neighbour assured me was superb; and meatballs, which were devoured at a pace that would indicate they too were well received.

The evening ended with bluesy theatrical ballads from musicians _Howe,_ some fantastic ice-cream in fresh mint and salted caramel flavours (I was totally won over by the caramel) from artisan gelato chefs _Gelupo. _

Once I&#8217;d recovered from my cheese-hangover, I caught up with Bash to discover the secrets of a supper-club genius&#8230;

**<span style="color: #000000;">Hello Bash. Tell us a little about the conception of Forza Win. Had you done anything like it before? </span>**

No, I&#8217;d spent seven years in marketing, trying to sell others people stuff, and thought it about time I did something of my own. I had put on pop up gallery things about 5 years prior, and the odd party here and there but ultimately I liked supper clubs and had a decent sized garden in New Cross &#8211; I&#8217;d been threatening to build a pizza oven in there for about three years and when I finally got round to it, we ended up getting really carried away and starting on a rooftop instead!

**Was the pizza oven hard to make, or is it something we could all knock-out in our backyards?**

It&#8217;s not a _particularly_ hard thing to do, there are loads of great online instructions but you need to know your way around bricklaying, cement, vermiculite. We didn&#8217;t, so we enlisted the help of one of the greatest men I have ever met &#8211; Terry Edwards, who runs the &#8216;UK Woodfired Oven Forum&#8217;.

**How do you acquire the rooftop spaces?**

We use grappling hooks, mainly &#8211; send a crack team of balaclava&#8217;d pizza and fondue ninja&#8217;s up there to case the joint, then we start cooking great food and tell the owners of said rooftop they can eat free for 3 months if they don&#8217;t tell the cops. That&#8217;s not true. A lot of hard work and negotiation!

** Why fondue? Was it your mum reminiscing about 70s fondue parties that  made you think it was time for a comeback?**

Something like that. No, the name came before the cuisine, and it&#8217;s FONDUTA &#8211; not fondue, they are very different things. It&#8217;s an awesome sharing thing, it tastes amazing, and is great for Winter. And nobody had ever done it before, I guess that&#8217;s why.

**Apologies- _Fonduta._ (Should really do my research a little better&#8230;) Where do you source your food from? And what measures do you take to keep Forza green and eco-friendly?**

We source everything from the UK! We use the Ginger Pig for our meats, Gelupo for our Gelato, E5 Bakehouse for our breads (they are all f*cking incredible). Then our vegetables are all UK grown, organic and delicious. They all come from New Covent Garden Market, by way of a really awesome supplier. We make sure all of our food is organic and our wines biodynamic &#8211; we waste nothing.

**So how do you manage that? You serve up a hell of a lot of food!**

Anything that is left over is either eaten by staff, or my cats. I&#8217;m really anal about stuff like this, I hate waste, so we try to ensure that as little as possible makes its way to the bin. We have three different types of bin bag too, it&#8217;s a little annoying but you have to start somewhere!

**What do you predict is the future of the &#8220;pop-up&#8221; scene?**

Camel-back restaurants &#8211; they will be all the rage in 2013.  I&#8217;m not really one for questions like this, I read one of London&#8217;s really well known bar/ restaurant owners&#8217; predictions the other day and it was really obvious that he was just predicting all the stuff he was going to open. It put me off answering questions like that.

**Fair enough. There&#8217;s barely a month left for Forza Win(ter) bookings. Can we expect you back for the summer?**

Basic plan is to re-open Forza Win come end of May/ beginning of June, then potentially two other much larger scale projects alongside. Then same again in the Winter.

Another reason to look forward to summer&#8230;
