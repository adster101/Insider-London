Nestled in Kawasaki, Kanagawa Prefecture lies an eco-friendly marvel: the **Ukishima** complex. This facility is more than just an environmental centre; it's a beacon of sustainability, innovation, and community engagement, playing a pivotal role in education and infrastructure in the Greater Tokyo Area.

#### A Hub of Renewable Energy

At the core of the complex is the **Ukishima Solar Power Plant**. Completed in 2011 by Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), this 7 MW solar photovoltaic power station was one of Japan's largest solar power stations. It harnesses the abundant power of the sun to generate clean, renewable energy, symbolizing Japan's commitment to reducing carbon emissions and transitioning towards sustainable energy sources.

#### Recycling and Waste Management

Adjacent to the solar power plant is the state-of-the-art **recycling and disposal facility**, dedicated to processing and recycling waste. This plant contributes significantly to Kawasaki's waste management efforts by employing advanced technologies to sort, process, and recycle various materials, reducing environmental impact. Witnessing the entire waste processing system in action is fascinating, offering a unique behind-the-scenes look at how waste is managed in urban areas is fascinating. For our exclusive groups, the tour provides a detailed walkthrough of the waste recycling journey, from collection to processing, demonstrating how vital efficient waste management is in today’s world.


#### Floating Island - Ukishima

Adding to the complex's uniqueness is the floating island known as **Ukishima**. This floating green space is a natural habitat and public park, providing a tranquil escape for residents and visitors. It's an innovative use of space that promotes biodiversity and offers an urban sanctuary where people can connect with nature. The floating island exemplifies how cities can incorporate green spaces into urban development, enhancing the overall quality of life.

#### Part of Japan’s Eco-Town Initiative

The Ukishima complex is an integral part of Japan’s ambitious **Eco-Town initiative**, a national project aimed at fostering sustainable urban development by integrating renewable energy, efficient waste management, and eco-friendly practices into urban planning. As one of the key sites in this initiative, Ukishima serves as a model for other cities, showcasing how industrial areas can be transformed into environmentally sustainable zones.

#### A Model for the Future

The **Ukishima Eco Gurashi Mirai-kan** complex is not just a collection of facilities; it's a model for a sustainable future. Through its integration of renewable energy, efficient waste management, and green spaces, it demonstrates how urban environments can evolve into more sustainable ecosystems. The complex offers a glimpse into a future where cities are not just concrete jungles but thriving ecosystems, and its interactive sessions make it an engaging and memorable experience.



#### Exclusive and Bespoke Tours

One of the most interesting aspects of visiting the Ukishima complex is the interactive sessions. The **interactive centre** allows visitors to experience the waste disposal process more vividly and engage with the complex's facilities in a dynamic and hands-on way. Although the centre is typically geared towards educational groups, **Insider London's bespoke tours** are tailored to provide a deeply informative experience. Our private groups will have the chance to witness the entire process up close, offering insights that go beyond a typical public tour.
