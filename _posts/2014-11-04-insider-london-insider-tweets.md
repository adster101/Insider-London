Whether you are a tourist, a local or just a London enthusiast, the fact that you have landed on our site tells us that you are potentially on the lookout for something a little different and alternative rather than the usual London experiences that you might expect to find in this great city.

Well, you’ve certainly come to the right place! We are passionate about all things ‘off the beaten track’, proud to offer a range of tours from an [alternative history](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/sightseeing-london-walking-tours/) of London to a route outlaying all that is [eco-friendly](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-eco-green-sustainable-walking-tour/) about this ever evolving metropolis of ours.

And we are now also proud to say we’re part of a larger group of London enthusiasts, finding our way into the top 20 of the most influential London tweeters, as chosen by the guys at Hotel Direct.

Their [London team](http://www.hoteldirect.co.uk/london/) were looking for a way to spread the word not only about the quirkier side of the capital, but also events and attractions that might not be featured in your average guide book. So they created [this](https://twitter.com/hoteldirect/lists/hotel-direct-s-ldn-guide) list: free to subscribe to for tourists and locals alike. Collating feeds of Londonites from the world of fashion and food, architecture and art, you can be sure to find all the latest information in one easy to digest list. We&#8217;re in great company, joined by the likes of our friends <a href="/petra-barran-kerb-interview/" target="_blank">KERB</a>.

Every week, Hotel Direct will be interviewing each member of the list on their blog, to find out what each influencer can offer to you London-lovers out there, with our very own [Frances featuring in this week’s interview](http://events.hoteldirect.co.uk/twitter-guide/insider-london/).

And, if you&#8217;re not following us already, our twitter feed can be found at <a href="https://twitter.com/insiderlondon" target="_blank">@insiderlondon</a>.
