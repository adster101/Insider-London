Street artists become household names thanks to an easily identifiable style, so this week we&#8217;re looking at a couple of street art heavyweights over the past two decades, and how they&#8217;ve adapted their work.

The above piece is an old favourite by Invader, photographed on Holywell Lane/Curtain Road. It&#8217;s hard to resist the force of Luke and Darth, right? Named after Space Invaders, he&#8217;s best known for his depiction of those very same computer game characters, recreating them in square ceramic tiles. This Star Wars tribute not his only interpretation of iconic figures: last year, he recreated characters including <a href="http://www.streetartnews.net/2014/01/invader-invades-hong-kong-part-iv.html" target="_blank">Hong Kong Phooey and Popeye in Hong Kong</a>.

This second picture, meanwhile, shows a work by Ben Eine &#8211; best known for his 3-coloured letters on street shutters. This piece, created last summer in Club Row with spray cans, is a much more involved mural with elaborate lettering.
