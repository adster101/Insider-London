#### Deliveroo's Rise in the Startup World

The concept of Deliveroo was born when [Will Shu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/william-s-163bbb11/), a former investment banker, realised the low-quality food delivery options in London and decided to create a platform connecting customers with their favourite local restaurants. To achieve this, he teamed up with [Greg Orlowski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/greg-orlowski-705a2152/), a software developer, and together they worked to disrupt the traditional food delivery model by leveraging technology and innovation. They created a user-friendly app that provided customers with a seamless ordering experience while giving restaurants a platform to grow their business.

#### Deliveroo's Path to IPO and Public Listing

Deliveroo is a food delivery company known for its efficient logistics and user-friendly interface. By partnering with premium restaurants that previously did not offer delivery, Deliveroo expanded the options available to consumers. Deliveroo's pursuit of excellence helped it become a unicorn company in just a few short years. By 2017, Deliveroo had secured over [$500 million in funding](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jul/02/deliveroo-set-to-become-a-tech-unicorn-as-investors-seek-a-slice), cementing its position as one of the UK's most valuable startups. Deliveroo now has a presence in over 500 cities worldwide and is synonymous with convenience, reliability, and quality in the food delivery space. The company continued to innovate, introducing new services like Deliveroo Plus, a subscription service offering free delivery, and Editions, a platform for virtual restaurants exclusively available on Deliveroo. These [innovative services](https://www.centuroglobal.com/blog/an-international-expansion-case-study-deliveroo/) kept the company at the forefront of the food delivery industry. In March 2021, Deliveroo achieved another significant milestone by [going public](https://www.londonstockexchange.com/discover/news-and-insights/london-stock-exchange-welcomes-deliveroo-holdings-plc-main-market) on the London Stock Exchange.
