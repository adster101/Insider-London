#### Who are Komodo?

We Are Komodo (Komodo) is a full-service creative agency that was founded in 2017 with the mission to create meaningful experiences that drive impact and inspire change. They have offices in four continents: London, Sydney, Los Angeles, and Bangkok. They work with over 100 clients across various industries, such as tourism, fashion, beauty, and entertainment.

The company has a talented team of over 70 people who offer five distinct services: talent management, content creation, events and activations, social media, and performance marketing.

Komodo has achieved several milestones since its inception. They completed their first Influencer Activation in November 2017.

They opened their second office in Sydney, Australia in March 2019, and their third office in Los Angeles, USA in January 20201. In April 2020, they signed their 100th client and launched an award-winning campaign #thankstotravel1. In March 2021, they opened their fourth office in Bangkok, Thailand, making it four offices in four continents! In April 2022, Komodo launched its sister company [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) -  an applied AI research company shaping the next era of art, entertainment and human creativity.
