While we&#8217;re sure this fact hasn&#8217;t escaped your notice, here&#8217;s a gentle reminder that Christmas is now only 10 days away. If you&#8217;re struggling to find gifts, here are our suggestions for the lover of London in your life. Far better than your average souvenir&#8230;

Or, our favourite way to get to know London, is on one of the Insider London tours. You can <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/alternative-london-walking-tours-unusual-londongifts/" target="_blank">buy a gift voucher</a> for any of our tours, whether <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-underground-tube-tours/" target="_blank">a whistle-stop history of the tube </a>or getting into the festive spirit (quite literally) with our <a href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-pub-tours-drinking-tour/" target="_blank">History of Drinking Tour</a>. Take a look at to the left hand column to see our full range: all of our tours are available in gift voucher form, and the voucher can be redeemed on a date that suits the recipient &#8211; meaning you have something to look forward to once the Christmas period is over, and the last present has been unwrapped, too.
