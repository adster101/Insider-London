**So I went up the shard last week with some sneaky preview tickets.**

**There was talk of snow, and I was bracing myself for a fantastic view of a great white nothing. But in fact the view turned out to be pretty bloody marvelous, with a clear yet moody sky, as you can gather from my amateur photography skills. ****My companion rather _hilariously_ informed me on our way there that the 6 metre per second lift that I&#8217;d read about was &#8220;not working yet&#8221;, and so I was bracing myself for a 72-floor hike that would take us &#8220;probably about half an hour&#8221;. So all things considered, no snow and no hike, things were going better than expected so far.**

Surreally, the first few minutes inside the building felt first like an airport (excessive scanners), and then the welcoming reception to an adult Disneyland, with sentimentally rousing music and a photo-op in front of a green screen that, you guessed it, became a backdrop of the View from the Shard for you to purchase in the lobby afterwards like a souvenir from a log-flume (minus the screaming faces- unless you were _really_ excited).

We were escorted round a few nondescript hallways, some with video sequences of fun facts and views of London etc (I&#8217;ll be honest, I was far to busy wanting to _get to the top_ that I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to anything else), and ushered away from enticing doorways (one of which had had _so_ many nosy so-and-so&#8217;s poking there noses in it they&#8217;d had to wedge a long wooden plank through the door-handles: classy).

Definite ear-popping in the lift on the way up- a sign we&#8217;re getting high. Whizzed up through what will be twenty-eight floors of offices, three floors of restaurants, eighteen floors of Shangri-La Hotel, and ten apartments (each expected to fetch between £30m and £50m). And then, up some stairs and: BOOM.

Through one of 11,000 panes of glass (_and, on a side note, these are not just single panes of glass: there&#8217;s single glazing on the outside, double-glazing on the inside, and a thin retractable blind in-between)_ I could see _miles_ (40 to be exact) of houses and borrowers and skyscrapers and all the other things crammed into this really rather over-crowded looking city, come to mention it. Old Renzo was right when he emphasised that the main reason the Shard was sustainable was that it went _upwards_ and not _outwards:_ I couldn&#8217;t see anywhere for it to _fit_ if it wasn&#8217;t so skinny.

There are some rather good telescopes that aren&#8217;t really like telescopes at all, more like big swivelly point-and-shoot computers. But I was more enamoured with the real deal beyond the glass: if I want to see bits of London up close I can just go stand in it, but it ain&#8217;t so often you get to see it all in one massive sprawling, living landscape. And of course there&#8217;s the open-air, 72nd floor; the bit you want to point at afterwards and say _&#8220;I was up there._&#8221; Feeling the chill of 804ft-high sky lends a blast of reality that makes the whole experience freshly exciting all over again.

I won&#8217;t comment on the price-tag, despite that being most people&#8217;s first question: _&#8220;So, would you pay&#8230;?&#8221;._ I _do_ know that everyone on that deck barely noticed each other as they took their positions at a pane of glass for the fifth time that morning, entirely engrossed  in a city that is so familiar but rendered completely anew from a new, calmer perspective.

And if a sentimental, transcendental moment with your beloved city isn&#8217;t enough to tempt you, there&#8217;s always that infamous loo&#8230;
