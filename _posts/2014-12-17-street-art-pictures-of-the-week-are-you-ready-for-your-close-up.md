Portraits have been a form of art for centuries so perhaps it&#8217;s not surprising that faces are a common theme for street art too. Shoreditch, especially, seems to specialise in close-up faces, which can be spotted in a huge range of styles. We&#8217;ve captured three examples of the phenomenon here &#8211; do let us know in the comments if you have more examples you&#8217;d like to share.

Unknown artist, a new piece spotted in the alleyway between Brick Lane and Allen Gardens.

Same alleyway, this is the work of UK artist Inkfetish.

This final example is by the Italian artist RUN &#8211; you can [see another example of his work from earlier in the year here](/street-art-london-run-at-ram-place-fashion-market-hackney/). This piece is on Grimsby Street, retouched over one of his old pieces.
