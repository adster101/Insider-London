London has once more defended its title as the top tourism destination for the United Kingdom.

This is according to the latest figures from the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions (ALVA) published in [the Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/uk-visitor-attractions-british-museum-tate-modern-terrorism-trains-a8258261.html), which show the capital was home to the top ten most popular tourist must-see attractions in the country.

Coming in second to the Big Smoke was Scotland's capital city Edinburgh, which nabbed the 11th and 12th top tourist spots. 

London walking tours are a great way to tick off [a few of London's top sights](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/sustainable-london-architecture-tour/), which include Somerset House, the Southbank Centre and the Tower of London. 

The British Museum remains the biggest attraction for tourists, bringing in 5.9 million visitors in 2017, while Tate Modern took second place and the British Museum took third, followed by the V&A and the Science Museum. 

Director of the ALVA Bernard Donoghue was quoted by the newspaper as saying: "Overseas leisure visitors say that their primary reasons to visit the UK are to experience our history, heritage and world-leading cultural institutions, and this is borne out by 2017 visitor numbers."

He added that London tourism stood up to some challenges in 2017, namely the threat of terrorism and disruption to train travel.

Another factor that might be preventing tourists from taking the London trip of their dreams is the fear of it all getting very expensive, but a little forward planning could help avoid high prices.

TripAdvisor recommends booking three to five months in advance for the best room rates, while choosing a winter getaway could mean better deals than in peak visiting times such as the summer holidays.
