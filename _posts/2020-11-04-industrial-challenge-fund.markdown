In 2018 an exciting competitive call to academia and industry was announced by the UK government. [The Industry Strategy Challenge Fund](https://www.ukri.org/innovation/industrial-strategy-challenge-fund/) is for innovators in the UK who are researching, designing, and engineering the solutions to the big challenges of the future. This fund consists of around £2.6 billion of public money, matched with £3 billion from the private sector. 

There are 23 challenges appealing for entrants, which come under the four themes of the UK government’s current industrial strategy: AI and the data economy, ageing society, clean growth, and the future of mobility. This week, we took a look at funding winners from each of these four subsets.

### AI and the data economy
There are five challenges in this category:
-	Audience of the future (immersive technology)
-	Commercialising quantum technologies 
-	Creative industries clusters
-	Digital security by design
-	Next generation services (tech for the service sector)
One striking winner from the “Audience of the Future” challenge is the Royal Shakespeare Company consortium – winners of £16 million. Led by the RSC, the consortium consists of 14 partners including De Montford University, Intel, Marshmellow Laser Feast and Epic Games. This [two year project](https://www.rsc.org.uk/news/how-will-audiences-experience-live-performance-in-the-future) explores the possibility of live performances combined with emerging technology with VR, AR, MR and more. 

### Ageing Society
There are four challenges in this category:
-	Acceleration of detection of disease
-	Healthy ageing
-	Data to early diagnosis and precision medicine
-	Leading-edge healthcare
In the data to early diagnosis and precision medicine challenge, [Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/about-biobank-uk/) aims to sequence the genes of all 500,000 volunteers. This charity has a long term vision to research why some people develop particular diseases whilst others do not. 

### Clean Growth
There are eight challenges in this category:
-	Industrial decarbonisation

One of the most interesting winners in this category is Healthtech star [Apian](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/space-company-takes-to-the-skies-alongside-the-nhs) – part of the NHS Clinical Entrepreneur programme. This start-up is focused on creating secure air corridors for electric drones to carry COVID-19 samples, test kits and PPE thereby minimising physical contact, freeing up staff and streamlining transportation. The drones will use satellite-enabled GPS.
