As shop shutters remain firmly closed and offices are empty, businesses are scrambling to reposition themselves in these unprecedented and unwelcome, times. Overall consumer spending has [plummeted](https://www.ft.com/content/d184fa0a-6904-11ea-800d-da70cff6e4d3) with obvious nosedives in, but not exclusive to, travel, hospitality and the majority of leisure industries. 
With a different retailer in the news daily, ([Debenhams](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52182199) , [Cath Kidston](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52172005) and many more), then what IS money being spent on?

### 1. Technology
Whilst supply chain problems continue to shake the tech sector, telehealth and teleconferencing have become a [crucial part of daily life](https://www.businessinsider.com/five-ways-coronavirus-will-affect-the-connectivity-tech-industry-2020?r=US&IR=T) for many. Zoom has unsurprisingly reported [huge gains](https://www.asiaone.com/money/company-might-be-biggest-winner-crisis). 
But it’s not all doom-and-gloom. Business insiders report that developers involved in the world of Virtual Reality technology (VR) are experiencing a huge upsurge in their companies’ workload. Given the current lockdown circumstances perhaps it no surprise that now the upward trends in the deployment of VR is driven by peoples need to implement the technology to mirror real-life circumstances. Other developers have benefitted from governments around the world commissioning new tech in the Covid-19  crisis from [disinfectant spraying drones in South Korea to government chat boxes in Australia](https://www.wsj.com/articles/fever-detecting-goggles-and-disinfectant-drones-countries-turn-to-tech-to-fight-coronavirus-11583832616?utm_source=Triggermail&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Post%20Blast%20bii-connectivity-and-tech:%20Five%20ways%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic%20could%20impact%20the%20connectivity%20and%20tech%20industries&utm_term=BII%20List%20Connectivity%20Content%20ONLY)

### 2. Fitness 

Whilst gyms have closed, online fitness and wellness has surged. In China, exercise app “Keep” moved quickly, switching from hosting only pre-recorded classes to including livestreamed classes and is now [reaping the benefits](https://news.cgtn.com/news/2020-03-31/Discover-the-world-of-online-fitness-during-the-COVID-19-pandemic-P9jWHcrPc4/index.html). 
In the UK, JD.com has reported a [56% rise in the sales of skipping rope, a 60% rise for dumbbells  and a 150% rise in yoga mats](https://nocamels.com/2020/03/coronavirus-economy-5-industries-thriving/). 

### 3. Online Education
Whilst some report the education sector as being one of the most reluctant sectors in adopting new technology, before the Covid-19 crisis, the global education technology sector (EdTech) was still growing by [more than 15% per year](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/2020-04-02/coronavirus-pandemic-tests-countries-abilities-to-create-effective-online-education). As social distancing continues however, institutions have been forced online by necessity, and populations look to spend their newfound home-time deepening their knowledge bases and learning new skills.

### 4. Gardening 
Though garden centres face enormous difficulties as huge quantities of their stock [potentially go to waste](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-devon-52111584) this, sadly, is not through lack of consumer want.
In particular, the Royal Horticultural Society and National Vegetable society have reported a huge  [surge in first-time vegetable growers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-52009161). Britain is spending more time in its gardens, looking for new leisure activities and [questioning insecurities in our food system](https://www.itv.com/news/london/2020-03-23/gardeners-turning-to-grow-your-own-during-coronavirus-crisis/). Trends for container and balcony planting are also [growing increasingly popular](https://www.ft.com/content/081aefd8-63a7-11ea-a6cd-df28cc3c6a68).
