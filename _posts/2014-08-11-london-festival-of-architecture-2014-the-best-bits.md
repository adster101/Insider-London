Londoners with a keen eye for design will have had plenty to behold this summer, thanks to the Festival of Architecture, a celebration first initiated by The Architecture Foundation ten years ago. From family events to professional competitions, indoor exhibitions to outdoor spaces, there’s been a lot going on in the capital city – ‘Capital’ itself being the theme for 2014 &#8211; with the festival featuring over 150 installations. Check out our round-up of the best bits from this year’s collection.

[The Serpentine Pavilion](http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/serpentine-galleries-pavilion-2014-smiljan-radic)

Chilean architect, Smiljan Radić created this cylindrical shell. It sits suspended on quarry stones, designed to blend in with the natural landscape. The translucent shell is made from fibre glass, illuminating at night with a soft amber glow. Spectators are invited inside, with Park Nights events including poetry readings, live music and even a café.

 [Re-imagining Hammersmith](http://www.westlondonlink.co.uk/)

Four local Hammersmith schools sent their students on a mission to dream up a new area, with the help of university architecture students. Asked to envision the borough without the flyover, kids were tasked with creating idyllic images in the form of drawings, paintings or models, which were later displayed in Lyric Square.

 [The LEGO Challenge](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/event/209)

And from actual kids to adults who just wanted an excuse to play with LEGO, everyone was getting in on the fun. Four Stirling Prize-winning practices pitted their architects against other firms in a bid to construct the most creative cityscape. They had toy bricks, a team of A Level students and one hour and 45 minutes to put together the London of their imaginations.

[Bike Rides](http://www.londonarchitecturediary.com/)

For those who prefer their architecture outdoors, organised bike rides took groups on tours of the city’s centrepieces. Churches, canals and structures were covered on this all-wheeled expedition. For those who want to do some of their own exploring, you can always check out our [modern architecture walking tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-architecture-walking-tours/).

[Cloud Architecture](http://www.cloud-arch.com/)

On the subject of iconic landmarks, Old Spitalfields Market looks like it’s about to see some new faces. Cloud Architecture launched their crowdfunding attempt as part of the festival. They’re exploring the idea of a POP-UP studio, setting up their seven-strong team in amongst the traditional stalls.
