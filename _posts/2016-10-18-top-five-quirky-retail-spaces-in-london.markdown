London is home to quirky fashion, unique individuals and a number of distinct retail spaces. From high-tech futuristic spaces to repurposed and renovated pop-up malls, London has it all. And Insider London is here to round up the top five quirky retail spaces in London for you all.

## 1. Burberry
When you think of Regent Street, you may think high fashion, as opposed to quirky retail spaces. But Burberry’s unique shopping experience at the Regent Street store is definitely a quirky experience. Shoppers are encouraged to watch the catwalks that are screened in the store, and if an item catches your eye, you can make a purchase using the many iPads’ around the store. What also makes this store quirky is the huge juxtaposition between the historic building that Burberry calls its home and the modern ‘online’ shopping experience offered to customers.

## 2. Boxpark
Another quirky retail space that has made London it’s home is the iconic Boxpark. The Shoreditch branch was a retail revolution and when it open in 2011 and became the world’s first pop-up mall. Constructed of shipping containers, Boxpark was a unique and very low cost pop-up store. Each container is filled with a range of lifestyle and fashion brands, as well as cafes, restaurants and bars. This innovative shopping and dining experience has lead to the creation of another branch in the Croydon area. Opening at the end of October with a whole weekend of music performances, Boxpark Croydon will be home to the likes of The Breakfast Club, Meat Liquor and many many more. These shopping centers strive to create a community of talented brands whilst displaying some amazing fashion and innovative ideas.

## 3. Dover Street Market
This groundbreaking retail space, founded by Comme des Garçons designer Rei Kawakubo, had for twelve long years, spent its time in Mayfair. In it’s time this six-storey building broke many traditional retail rules and crafted a uniquely beautiful and creative shopping space, making it a distinctive shopping experience for all those who visited. And in March of this year the Dover Street Market relocated from Mayfair to Haymarket. The much larger store is home to all 14 Commes labels, as well as collections from the likes of Molly Goddard, Elena Dawson and Raf Simons.

## 4. Choccywoccydoodah
With a name like that you expect nothing less than quirky from the Brighton born chocolaterie. Whether you visit their mothership store in Brighton or their flagship in London’s Soho, shoppers will notice how the shop functions as more of an immersive gallery than a shop. The stunning products blend in with the elaborate decorations, creating an immersive atmosphere that serves more in an art gallery than a chocolate shop.

## 5. Cyberdog
Located in the bustling Camden Market is Cyberdog. You’ll find a whole host of clubbing attire for those who love techno and raves. Its futuristic style is evident as soon as you approach the shop, with two towering robots guarding the door and techno music pumping for all to hear. Once through the main doors customers will feel as if they have been transported to another world, the vibe, quirky clothing and music sets the tone and creates a unique shopping experience unlike any they may have faced before. Since it was established Cyberdog has since morphed into an accessible brand, with an underground vibe and you’ll find stores located in Manchester, Brighton and also Ibiza.
