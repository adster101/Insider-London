So, I was perusing the internet for some green inspiration this week, checking out some websites and reading my Google alerts (try it out if you haven&#8217;t already &#8211; amazing) when I came across something really unusual. A new craze is set to take the world by STORM (well, maybe, anyway you heard it here first!), a new form of literature if you will. Prepare yourself: the eco book.

  <p>
    No, not a crazy new publishing strategy that&#8217;ll have us all reading off bits of hemp and used plastic bags. A new genre of fiction: authors who write about the potential outcome of climate change, deforestation, and nuclear technology. The Day After Tomorrow in book form. And good. Really good.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Here are your top three eco-book-virgin starter texts. There&#8217;s something for everyone: a flooded London, huge volcanoes, tsunamis and abandoned woodland. Even if you have no interest in climate change, the explosive content will have you hooked.

    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Kraken-Wakes-John-Wyndham/dp/0140010750" target="_blank">The Kraken Wakes</a>Â by John Wyndham:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The book starts with fireballs falling from the sky into the sea: ships start sinking and sea tanks come to the surface. Two journalists chart the environmental progress as the sea levels start to rise and London is engulfed with water. It&#8217;s all bout what human kind will do to survive, and how we would deal with our own extinction. Surprisingly it was written in 1953, before we&#8217;d all gone &#8220;climate change&#8221; crazy, but the tone and urgency of the novel make it relevant today.

  </p>
  
  <p>
    Waking the Giant is all about how climate change could cause earthquakes, ferocious volcanoes and tsunamis, as well as extreme weather. McGuire is a geologist and reputable science writer, so this work gives you more of a factual spin on things. He suggests tectonic plates are shifting to a new equilbrium, and that our children&#8217;s children could see significant changes in their lifetimes to natural disasters.

    <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beyond-Last-Village-Discovery-Wilderness/dp/1559637994" target="_blank">Beyond the Last Village</a>, by Alan Rabinowitz:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    A first hand account of the author&#8217;s expedition through the huge woodlands of Northern Burma; his experiences within an environment we thought had been lost forever due to overpopulation. The touching scenes through the Himalayas are all about Rabinowitz&#8217;s escape from civilisation to a wilder normality. Along the way he encounters all sorts of fascinating things that exist everyday, and yet we in the cities never hear about: we meet the Rawang, a former slave group, the Taron, a solitary enclave of the world&#8217;s only pygmies of Asian ancestry, and Myanmar Tibetans.

    If you&#8217;ve read any of the above, or have always been an eco-book fan, let us know what you think. Is this new genre of sci-fi set to take the literary world by storm? Or is it just a bunch of pessimists expressing themselves through an ultimately environmentally unfriendly way (book production has huge printing wastage, uses harmful dyes for book covers and takes away from our natural resources)? Leave any eco-book inspired comments below.
