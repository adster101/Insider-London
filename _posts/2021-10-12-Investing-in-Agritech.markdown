### Agritech

*Agritech* is the use of technology to advance and improve the productivity and efficiency of agriculture.  2020 saw a record amount of [investment ](https://www.ingredientsnetwork.com/agritech-investments-hit-a-total-of-22-3-billion-news112223.html)in agritech companies: $22.3bn.  [Seedrs](https://www.insiderlondon.com/blog/seedrs-online/), a leading equity crowdfunding platform, identifies agritech as the next big start-up investment opportunity as there has been a shift in consumer behaviour. People want to know where their food is coming from, what impact the food they buy has on the environment, as well as a realisation that how over-reliant on global food supplies we have become.

### Fragility of Food Supply 

There has been much on the news about lack of resilience in the UK's food supply chain and how reliant we have become on international imports. With nearly fifty percent of the food being [imported](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/food-statistics-pocketbook/food-statistics-in-your-pocket-global-and-uk-supply), the UK has been experiencing supply shortages as Covid19 has brought global bottlenecks in the supply lines. The supply of food is also going to be influenced by the effects of climate change. Changes in weather, causing catastrophes, floods and droughts will affect the spaces in which people live as well as the amount of available space to successfully grow produce. 

### Harvest London

Becoming self-reliant and self-sufficient in food supply is not going to be possible without help from technology. This can allow agritech start-ups to augment and complement traditional agriculture to grow some of the food we currently import in a more sustainable way.

One of the most promising technologies in this area is vertical farming. 
[Harvest London](https://www.harvest.london/) is one of the innovative companies harvesting food on a made-to-order basis in controlled urban farms. They built the first vertical and hydroponic farm in London in 2016 growing over 100 different edible plants.  In 2019, they completed a successful funds raise through Seedrs of [£402,060](https://www.seedrs.com/harvestlondon) from 454 investors, with an initial target of £325,000, and in 2020 they opened a second farm in Leyton, East London. 

### Square Mile Farms

As the popularity of urban farming continues to rise, another strat-up [Square Mile Farms](https://www.squaremilefarms.com/), have noticed large employers rethinking the function and layout of their workspaces post Covid. With a lot of people still working from home, their *Office Farming* model 'creates inviting spaces, attracting talent back into the workplace' (seedrs.com). 

Their business model is based on installing vertical farms in workplaces with an estimated market size of £143m in London, and £621m in the UK., and moves into the inner cities, Square Mile Farms have positioned themselves well for a growing market. In 2020, with a crowdfunding goal of £200,010, they doubled their target, raising [£504,118](https://www.seedrs.com/square-mile-farms) from 891 investors on Seedrs.
