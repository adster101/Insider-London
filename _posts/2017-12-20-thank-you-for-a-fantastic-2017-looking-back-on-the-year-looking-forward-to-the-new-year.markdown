The year 2017 is coming to an end. When it is time to convene with our nearest and dearest, it is also time to look back. We’ve had a wonderful 2017 –  thank you all!

## Thank you, guests!

First and foremost, we want to thank all of our guests who joined on our tours! As a small company showcasing one of the most exciting cities in the world – our beloved London – your support means a great deal to us! We also specifically want to mention all of our guests who joined our fundraising tours in support of the 20in20 campaign for the MS Trust, and Guide Dogs!

With our educational tour portfolio, we also want to send our gratitude to all the universities we work with: King’s College London, Imperial College London, London Business School, Limkokwing, Kingston University London, the University of North Carolina, and all the other ones. 

Not only young learners joined us though. We had so many wonderful professionals and executives joining, among others from Investec, J.P Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Carrefour and more.

Thank you all for placing your trust in us! We truly appreciate it!

## Thank you, partners!

We couldn’t have done all of this alone though. We have a great team of guides, who are continuously curious about London and its many facets, from finance to business, marketing and entrepreneurship to sustainability. 

And last, but certainly not least, our fantastic partners! Without them, we couldn’t have done our amazing and insightful business visits – after all, it’s all about them: Verb Brands, Wayra, Impact Hub, Innovation Warehouse, Razorfish, London Calling, Think Rise, and so many more.

## What's to come

The end of one year is also the beginning of the next – and we’re up to a few exciting things! We have a few new and intriguing businesses lined up to visit next year. Furthermore, we’ve got at least two more new tours up our sleeves.

There’s the **[King’s Cross Regeneration Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/kings-cross-regeneration/)**: It’s all about the redevelopment of the area from rural city escape to freight hub to shady suburb to a vibrant part of the city that even attracts Google. Arts, transport, tech, architecture, you name it; there’s a bit for everyone. 

For your checklist of London’s sights, we have the **Westminster Highlights Tour**: In just two hours, you will learn all about the greatest sights in the City of Westminster. It’s all about the things you must not miss when visiting London.

As you can see, we’re looking forward to a great 2018. And so we’d like to end with our favourite quote by Samuel Johnson:

When one is tired of London, they are tired of life.

Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
