Stik is one of the best known street artist &#8211; instantly recognised for his stick-like figures. At home on the streets of London, you can now find works by Stik all over the world.

He&#8217;s been hitting headlines recently for &#8216;Big Brother&#8217; on a condemned tower block in Acton. At 125ft high, it claims to be the world&#8217;s tallest street art mural. More importantly, the work is intended to highlight the lack of low income housing London. You can seeÂ <a href="http://stik.org/news.html" target="_blank">pictures on his blog</a>.

  Although Stik&#8217;s work now can sell for big money, there&#8217;s often a political message behind his work &#8211; they&#8217;re not as simplistic as they might first appear.
