There’s something big and exciting coming to the capital this summer and [it’s the perfect activity to consider doing](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/) after you’ve finished your London sightseeing tours.

If you’ve got a head for heights and want to see the Big Smoke from a slightly different perspective, why don’t you get yourself a couple of tickets for [Zip World London](https://www.zipworld.co.uk/adventure/detail/zip-world-london)? Make your way to London’s Southbank, strap yourself in and be ready for the ride of your life, taking off from a height of more than 100ft… which is longer than nine double decker buses!

This is certainly one of the best ways of seeing the iconic London skyline, including Big Ben, so if you do want to see the sights but are keen to get off the beaten track a little this would be a wonderful choice for you.

An adult ticket will set you back £22.50, but if you really want to make a day of it you can go for the Velocity pack that costs £49 per person and will get you two rides, a T-shirt and a photo you can keep for posterity.

Founder of Zip World London Barry Shaverin was recently [quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-to-get-50mph-urban-zip-wire-which-will-be-fastest-in-any-major-city-in-the-world-a3573656.html): “I see it as a decent halfway house between a rollercoaster and a bungee jump. It’ll be exciting but not terrifying. Giant zip lines and the greatest cityscape in the world — it seemed such an obvious idea to put the two together. And Archbishop’s Park is one of London’s best-kept secrets. We really want to help it get the attention it deserves.”

While at the park, why don’t you see if you can make time for a game of netball or tennis, since there are some lovely courts here as well? Cricket nets are also available without the need for booking – so you could have a very busy day if that’s what you’re after!
