Howdy! Our street art picture this week is this rather handsome cowboy. London isn&#8217;t really known for its stetson-wearing cowboys, so perhaps it comes as no surprise that this one comes courtesy of an LA-based graffiti artist, El Mac. You can read more about <a href="http://elmac.net/" target="_blank">his work here</a>.
