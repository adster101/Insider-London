We’re big fans of Belgian street art Roa at Insider London, so we were delighted to see a new piece on Shoreditch’s Leonard Street. Known for his huge black and white depictions of animals and for depicting some of the planet’s less-loved creatures, true to form, this time he’s depicted a giant flea.
