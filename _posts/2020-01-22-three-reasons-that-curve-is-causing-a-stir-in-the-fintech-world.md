2019 was the year that London-based Fintech firm [Curve](https://www.curve.app/en-gb/) consistently hit the headlines and its [valuation soared to $250 million](https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/15/over-the-top-banking/). Last year Curve raised $4M in 4 minutes with their [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.finextra.com/pressarticle/79655/curve-raises-4m-in-minutes-on-crowdcube) and their growth shows no sign of slowing.

So why is everyone talking about Curve?

1. **Their Unique Proposition**<br><br>Financial Times journalist David Stevenson called the success of Curve a ['highlight of his 2019'](https://www.altfi.com/article/6047_the-altfi-teams-favourite-fintech-apps-in-2019) and reported that he even invested into the record-breaking crowdfund himself.<br><br>Curve is not a challenger bank but is an aggregator of existing credit and debit cards. The app boasts 100 cards in one (https://www.curve.app/en-gb/) and allows users to choose the card they want to pay with. Afterwards any transaction under £1,000 can even be rolled back onto another card with the ["Go Back in Time"](https://support.imaginecurve.com/hc/en-gb/articles/115003750829-What-is-Go-Back-in-Time-) feature.

2. **The launch of "Curve Send"**<br><br>December saw Curve launch a new way to send money between the accounts – [free from conversion fees](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2019/12/155519-uk-based-fintech-curve-introduces-curve-send-a-new-way-to-send-money-between-accounts-free-of-cost/).<br><br>Focused on making the process more simple for customers, recipients of the currency do not have to be Curve customers and the service allows for cross-border transactions in 25 currencies in more than [30 European countries](https://support.imaginecurve.com/hc/en-gb/sections/360000715257-Curve-Send). As Curve goes intercontinental in 2020 these services are only [set to expand](https://bankinnovation.net/allposts/biz-lines/payments/with-cross-border-payments-curve-positions-itself-to-challenge-legacy-providers/).

3. **Curve is continually advancing**<br><br>This month, January 2020 saw yet another feature added. You can now pay using Curve with a [range of "wearable" smart devices](https://www.businesscloud.co.uk/news/curve-adds-wearables-to-payment-offering), not just a mobile phone. Partnering with a range of firms (Garmin, Fitbit and Sony), Curve users can now upload a card to their smart watches and pay with any bank even if it was previously [incompatible with the device](https://thepaypers.com/online-payments/uk-based-fintech-curve-signs-up-garmin-fitbit-and-sonys-wena-pay--1239972).
