When your belly starts to rumble... the question on every Londoner's mind is: where to eat now?

Our much-loved capital offers the widest variety of cuisine on the planet. Have you tried some our cosmopolitan favourites?


## LONDON AS A HISTORIC MELTING POT


London has always experienced waves of migration right from her earliest period with the [Romans and the Germanic tribes](https://www.migrationwatchuk.org/Briefingpaper/document/48) building out proud city. Jumping to the modern period, the sixteenth and seventeenth century saw London become a global trading power and therefore a melting pot of international merchants.


To name just one example, Huguenots fleeing France [found refuge in London](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/refugee-week-the-huguenots-count-among-the-most-successful-of-britains-immigrants-10330066.html) and set up shop in the City Fringes. Along with the Jewish community, these expert silk traders transformed the economy of this area which became known as “weaver town” and grew into a [booming textile hub.](http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/immig_emig/england/london/article_1.shtml)


Post-second world war, the Empire Windrush brought workers from Jamaica, Trinidad, Tobago and other Carribean islands to [rebuild a devasted city](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/43793769). Their legacy lives in not just in the infrastructure of the capital but through Nottinghill Carnival, a proud disaplay of [colourful multi-culturalism](https://ndla.no/en/node/90712?fag=71082).



London now benefits from the most diverse and exciting menu of the twenty-first century - so take a culinary trip around the world with 5 our favourite London restaurants!
 
 


## 1. CHINESE 


Mostly from Hong-Kong, a former british colony until 1997, a vibrant Chinese community came to settle in Central London, particularly in colourful Soho. Due to its cheap rent, a community gathered at Gerard street and began building up today's bustling streets . With British soldiers' nostalgia of Far Eastern food, [Chinatown](https://chinatown.co.uk/en/about-us/) was born!

### [CHINATOWN BAKERY](https://chinatown.co.uk/en/restaurant/chinatown-bakery/)



At the front of this cosy bakery, a curious machine is cooking fish... Indeed, Chinatown bakery offers delicious fish-shaped waffles - 4 for only £2. Inside, a large range of sweet but also salted cakes are on offer to satisy all tastes. From pork buns to black sesame rolls or moon cakes, everything is priced affordably with snacks from £1.30!

## 2. TURKISH 


During the second half of the twentieth century, [three waves of migration](http://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2005/05/26/turkish_london_feature.shtml) motivated by political events such as the Cyprus conflict of 1974 led to the departure of a large number of turkish citizens. Today, over 90,000 turkish people live in London.
