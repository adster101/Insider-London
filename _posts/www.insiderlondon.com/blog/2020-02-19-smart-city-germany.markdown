**1. The EUREF Campus in Berlin**

Home to around [150 companies and institutions with a total of 3,500 staff](https://www.businesslocationcenter.de/en/zukunftsorte-en/euref-campus-berlin/), EUREF brings together global players, start-ups, government and academics into a single hub. The EU funded project is the only hub of its kind in Europe, with the mission of designing, testing and applying smart city technology. This innovative business eco-system demonstrates that the transition to a sustainable and connected future is affordable and feasible.

This is demonstrated not only by the projects and companies located at EUREF but also by the campus itself. The [“real world urban laboratory”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRv6ISwHNJU) puts into practice the latest technology to create a model urban district. Campus energy is generated by 100% renewable resources (geo-thermal, wind, solar and biogas) and [distributed by a micro grid into intelligent buildings](https://www.se.com/ww/en/work/campaign/life-is-on/case-study/euref.jsp ). The pilot district boasts Germany’s largest solar charging station for EVs, and autonomous vehicles have been put into use throughout the site.

**2.	Hydrogen powered trains**
In 2018 Germany rolled out the world’s first hydrogen-powered train – the [iLint](https://www.alstom.com/our-solutions/rolling-stock/coradia-ilint-worlds-1st-hydrogen-powered-train). This rare hydrail system is being hailed by many as the future of low carbon or carbon zero rail services. In a hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen and an oxidant combine to generate electricity. The only by-product is water, which in theory should be clean enough to drink - a far cry from the dirty diesel used by regular trains. 
Germany currently operates the only two hydrogen rail services in the world. [As other countries look on with interest](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-48698532) then the German service is set to expand to [another 14 states by 2021](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/sep/17/germany-launches-worlds-first-hydrogen-powered-train). It seems highly likely that Berlin will soon be the first hydro-connected European capital.

**3.	AI Powered Trams**
2018 also saw Germany quietly launch another world-first in sustainable transport – driverless trams. In Potsdam, just west of Berlin, this remarkable technology represents an important milestone in smart city technology. A combination of radar, lasers and camera sensors form [“digital eyes”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/23/potsdam-inside-the-worlds-first-autonomous-tram)which record the entire journey, enabling the tram to react to signals and hazards faster than any human.
