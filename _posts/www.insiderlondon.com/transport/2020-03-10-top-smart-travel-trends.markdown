*This week we take a stock check of the most innovative consumer travel products now on sale and currently in development. Read on for our top five smart travel trends!*

## 1.	Technology which promotes accessibility

IBM Japan are developing an [AI-driven robotic suitcase](https://www.inceptivemind.com/chieko-asakawa-smart-suitcase-shaped-robot-visually-impaired/12035/) which could help travellers with visual disabilities. This fascinating new technology comes complete with a sensor and camera to detect obstacles and will alert users of their surroundings through tactile sensations allowing the user to travel more safely. 

## 2.	Luggage with more inbuilt features


Further to IBM Japan, other companies like Berlin-born start-up [Horizn](https://horizn-studios.co.uk) are also leading the trend with smart luggage. Horizn luggage comes with an integrated removable battery to charge phones with a [USB charger](https://horizn-studios.co.uk/en/travel-tech/) as well as a GPS tracker which automatically switches into flight mode once the luggage is in the air. The “no bag left behind feature” this produce also incorporates Bluetooth to send users a notification if their luggage is more than 30m away. 


## 3.	Smart Travel Assistants

Horizn also claims the title of the world’s first luggage with a personal travel assistant. Their luggage comes with a one year free membership to their smart travel app, [Horizn Go](https://horizn-studios.co.uk/en/go/). This helpful app includes accommodation, flights, transfers and other experiences.
Chatbots or “Smart Travel Assistants” have been around in the travel and booking arena for a while but [some companies](https://www.eyefortravel.com/distribution-strategies/smart-travel-assistants-new-gateway-travel-0) are now taking this technology to a whole new level. 


## 4.	Wearables taking over

A month ago UK Fintech Curve partnered with a range of [wearable smart devices](https://www.insiderlondon.com/blog/three-reasons-that-curve-is-causing-a-stir-in-the-fintech-world/) to allow users to upload a card to their smart watches and pay with any bank, even if it was previously incompatible with the device. Now travel cruise line Virgin Voyages has created a trendy looking digital wristband which serves [a variety of functions](https://www.ttgmedia.com/news/news/virgin-voyages-unveils-smart-technology-wristband--21162) . Once activated, this tech allows passengers a host of handy features; they can unlock their room, create a bar tab, make onboard purchases, play at the casino and much more. Made from recycled ocean plastic, this convenient device will be shipped to passengers before their voyage.
