We often focus on individual artists as our street art picture of the week. This week we&#8217;re looking at two longtime favourites to demonstrate just how varied street art is in Shoreditch.

This shot is taken on Princelet street. On the left is a work by <a href="/street-art-pictures-of-the-week-stik/" target="_blank">Stik</a> we featured back in December, while in the centre is a piece byÂ Otto Schade, or Osch, who you may remember from his piece on <a href="/smiley-otto-schade-street-art-london-brick-lane/" target="_blank">Brick Lane</a>. On the right, there are the many layers of different artists works that&#8217;s so typical of the area.
