This well-accessorised fellow is the result of a collaboration between Unga of Broken Fingaz Crew and INSA. If the bright chevrons aren&#8217;t enough to convince you to put on your shades, it&#8217;s even more mind-boggling than it might first appear.

We also had the fun of interviewing Broken Fingaz Crew last year, <a href="%20http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2013/02/15/london-street-art-walking-tours-broken-fingaz-crew/" target="_blank">you can have a read of that here</a>.
