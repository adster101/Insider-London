[If you’re planning some walking tours in London](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/) in the near future, make sure you pick a route that takes you past some of the museums the city has to boast. Why, we hear you ask? Because the city has just been revealed as being the museum capital of the entire world!

A new report from the Themed Entertainment Association has just revealed that four of the museums to be found in London [were in the top 20](http://www.aol.co.uk/travel/2017/06/04/london-named-museums-capital-of-the-world/) of the most-visited sites around the world last year, with just Washington DC and Washington DC alone the only other city to match this feat.

The British Museum, The National Gallery, Tate Modern and The Natural History Museum were all featured in the top 20 rundown, so if you’ve never been to any of these before and find yourself in London sometime soon make sure you make a pit stop off at one of them at least!

There are some great exhibitions going on right now, such as The British Museum’s [Hokusai display](http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on.aspx), or The National Gallery’s [Michelangelo & Sebastiano](https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/michelangelo-sebastiano-the-credit-suisse-exhibition) exhibit. If you decide that Tate Modern is more your speed, you’ll find a dazzling array of different exhibitions, including Wolfgang Tillmans, Fahrelnissa Zeid and Giacometti.

And you should certainly not neglect The Natural History Museum, which would be the perfect choice if you’re in the Big Smoke with your children. Make sure you head off to the tropical butterfly house before you go home again, while the Wildlife Photographer of the Year exhibition is also definitely worth a visit.
