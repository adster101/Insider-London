If you didn’t already know, the London Underground turned 150 on January 9th of this year. That date marks the first time a train left the Paddington Station to make a 3 ½ mile journey to Farringdon Station. Since then, metal carriages have transported close to a billion people a year to their final destination and everywhere in between. To celebrate, Insider London has pulled together some of the most interesting and/or ridiculous facts, inventive maps, and other quirks about London’s most important mode of transportation.

This is only part one of four, so make sure to keep your eyes peeled for more interesting facts!

12. The first crash on the Tube occurred in 1938 when two trains collided between Waterloo and Charing Cross, injuring 12 passengers.

13. Smoking was banned on the Underground as a result of the King&#8217;s Cross fire in November 1987 which killed 31 people. A discarded match was thought to be the cause of that inferno.
