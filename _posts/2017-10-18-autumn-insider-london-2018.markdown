Autumn has well and truly arrived in London. Leaves line the city streets, pumpkins decorate the shops and knitted jumpers are out in full force. You may think this season is not the best to take part in a walking tour. But you may be mistaken. Insider London have a number of winter warmer tours. You spend half your time inside and the other half out. Meaning you still get to explore London, whilst keeping warm and dry in this sometimes unforgiving season.

One tour, which is great for the whole family, is our [London Underground and Tube Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/london-underground-and-tube-tour/). In just two hours you can travel through 150 years worth of tube history, learning about one of the cities first underground stations, as well as one of London's most futuristic.

Another of our winter warmer tours is the [History of Drinking and Pubs ](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/history-of-drinking-and-pubs/)Tour. Please note this tour is only for those aged 18 and over, as we will be visiting a number of pubs on the way. You'll discover the story behind London's Gin Palaces, hear about the history of the drink that nearly drove beer (…and Londoners themselves) to extinction, whilst also visiting a pub which became a favourite drinking spot for the likes of Charles Dickens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Mark Twain and Dr Samuel Johnson.

And to get you in the spooky spirit of Halloween why not join us for our [Famous Ghosts and Infamous Murders Tour](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/famous-ghosts-and-infamous-murders/)? Whilst wandering around some of London's narrowest alleyways, you'll learn about some of the ghostly happenings and gruesome murders that have taken place around the city. You'll also get an opportunity to visit one of the many plague pits in London and venture down a haunted tunnel. Are you brave enough?

If you need further information about any of these tours please visit the tours pages. And don’t forget to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to keep up to date with Insider London.
