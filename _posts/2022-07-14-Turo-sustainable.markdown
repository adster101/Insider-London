This week we have a look at the car rental industry and how sustainable is it, and how car sharing is further disrupting the old business model.  
 
#### The Old Model 

Overall, the car industry is in a bit of trouble to say the least. This year saw a second consecutive decline in car ownership in the UK for the first time in 40 years. The car industry has been already grappling with semiconductor shortages, and this adds to the list of concerns for both manufacturers and policymakers.

Traditional rental companies like Hertz and Avis rely on owning hundreds of thousands of vehicles and have been unable to replenish their fleets for months after pandemic restrictions have been lifted. Even if they restock in the next couple of years, the increased maintenance cost of running cars is going to cut into their margins, and would only mean further rise in rental prices, which is already at a record high.
 
#### Disrupting the Old Model

Founded in 2010, [Turo](https://turo.com/gb/en) is often referred to as "the Airbnb of cars," and that's a pretty accurate way to describe it. Private car owners — which one could call "hosts" — post their vehicles on the service, offering others the chance to rent them for a short-term period. Turo simply acts as an intermediary (for which they take a small fee).  As in other shared-economy models, you're booking with an individual, not a corporation.

The selection of vehicles also can be much more varied — which can be a boon both for enthusiasts and those who like to plan extensively. While traditional rental car companies only offer broad categories when booking, Turo lets you know the exact car you'll be driving — year, make, model and options.

#### Environmental Benefits 

As private cars, for example, are parked 95% of the time on average, the car sharing eliminates the unused asset like never before. Instead of carpooling, there’s a fleet of cars on every corner, available at the push of a button.

Sustainable lifestyle choices of reusing and utilising the existing cars follow the idea that reducing excess capacity will produce an environmental benefit. Fewer resources are required in production: why make another car, if you can get people to rent out their own?
