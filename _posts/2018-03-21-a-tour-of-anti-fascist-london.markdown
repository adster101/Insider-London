The best [walking tours London has to offer](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/historical-walking-tours/) will not only introduce you to some aspects of London history you didn’t know about, but British history too. 

Head to some of these sites to learn more about London’s resistant and revolutionary past.

## The Battle of Cable Street

The Battle of Cable Street took place in [October 1936](http://time.com/4516276/cable-street-battle-london-east-end-80-years/), and was caused by Nazi sympathiser Oswald Mosely’s attempt to arrange a march of the fascist black shirts down Cable Street. Cable Street at the time was the centre of London’s Jewish community, as well as having many other ethnic groups living in the area. 

The march was designed to intimidate the local Jewish community, but marchers were faced with local groups who succeeded in disbanding the march, in what has been dubbed the Battle of Cable Street. 

## The Battle of Lewisham

Nearly 40 years after the Battle of Cable Street took place, a similar successful attempt to disband the National Front in Lewisham took place on the New Cross Road. 

This violent confrontation between the National Front and locals from Lewisham, New Cross and Deptford, resulted in the police losing control of Lewisham due to counter protests. At least 111 people were injured, including 56 police officers, and 214 people were arrested.

## Brixton

There were up to 5,000 people involved in the Brixton Riots in 1981, which saw local people take to the streets. Though there were many socioeconomic causes for the riots many argue the trigger for event was an incident in which the police tried to arrest a youth suffering from a four-inch stab wound, without seeking medical attention for him.  There are now murals near Coldharbour Lane.
