We&#8217;re talking stealth street art this week: art work that would rather blend into the city streets, than stand out. There&#8217;s no big signatures on these. They are often more temporary in nature. Above is the work of Art Is Tra$h, spotted on Redchurch Street: his pieces tend to last for a day or two maximum. In keeping with his art, this Spanish artist keeps a very low profile and works very quickly, illegally, wearing a utility belt with spray cans, paint and materials. Typically a piece takes just 10 to 15 minutes to complete.

We spotted the below on the alleyway between Brick Lane and Allen Gardens: we don&#8217;t know who is responsible for this piece, but it shows street art at its simplest &#8211; and most stealthy.
