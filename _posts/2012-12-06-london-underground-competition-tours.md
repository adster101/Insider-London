You might guess that we’re pretty excited about the 150<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the London Underground- and we’re thinking a lot of you tube-nerds out there are too! And what’s not to be excited about?
  
There’s going to be events: Steam trains! Restorations! Reinactments of the first tube journey!
  
There’s going to be _stuff happening on the trains:_ Poetry! Art! Theatre!
  
_And_ a bunch of collectable souvenir-y things for all you super-nerds, like oyster cards! Books! And coins!
  
And not only all of that, but there’s our exclusive _London Underground Tour_ to get you really hyped for the occasion, and the best part is: we’re giving you a chance to win tickets!

Yep, to get you _even more excited_ about the dear old London Underground’s 50<sup>th</sup> birthday (as if that were possible), we’re bringing you a stupendous competition with a whole heap of glorious underground-themed prizes to be won by YOU!

So, drum-roll please&#8230;

Along with two tickets to our London Underground tour you, lucky reader, could win:

Two tickets to the [BFI Southbank&#8217;s](http://www.bfi.org.uk) preview screening of Asquith’s stylish 1920s silent film _Underground,_ which is brilliant not only because it gives a glimpse of London&#8217;s transport of times past, but also because it has been painstakingly remastered by the BFI, _and_ features a score written especially by silent film accompanist Neil Brand_._ Wowza! But that&#8217;s not all: this is accompanied by a dinner for two at the Benugo restaurant at the BFI (with up to £150 to spend- fancy!).

And last but not least, you&#8217;ll receive a lovely bundle of Penguin books (underground themed, of course). These include _Underground_, chronicling the history of the subterranean systems that became the lifeblood of London through a series of previously unseen illustrations and images, and a beautiful, brand-spanking new edition of _Poems on the Underground,_ released especially for the occasion by Penguin. Cor blimey!

So, if any of this takes your fancy, you can enter our wonderful competition here: <a title="London Underground Competition" href="https://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-underground-competition/" target="_blank">London Underground Competition</a>
