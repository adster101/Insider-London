February is the cruellest month &#8211; or so the poem goes. Well, it&#8217;s certainly one of the coolest. We&#8217;ve been keeping ourselves busy, however. Here are our favourite posts from the last month.

Something to celebrate in the midst of Feb (other than Valentine&#8217;s Day. Or Pancake Day) was Chinese New Year. <span style="color: #4d4d4d;">London’s Chinese New Year celebrations are the biggest in the world outside China. We also looked at <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2015/02/16/celebrate-chinese-new-year-in-london/">Chinese investment in the capital</a>. Investors will be hoping that the Year of the Sheep brings additional prosperity. </span>

</p>

Another reason to celebrate was London&#8217;s showing at the Sustainable Restaurant Awards. We profiled [the London contenders on the shortlist here](Sustainable%20Restaurant Awards 2015). The winners have now been announced &#8211; winners included Wahaca, The Truscott Arms and Ceviche (a delicious-looking dish is pictured above).

Sustainability can mean many different things and &#8211; for something slightly different &#8211; we took an in-depth look at [the initiatives being implemented by the CrossRail project](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2015/02/23/making-tracks-crossrail-sustainability/).

London can do grand architectural schemes &#8211; as demonstrated by our post on the [ten facts you may not know about Tower 42](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2015/02/13/10-great-facts-about-tower-42/) &#8211; but not everything has to be quite so ambitious. We also explored how London architecture has embraced <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2015/02/20/london-container-capital/" target="_blank">the use of the shipping container</a>, on projects big and small.

And, for really micro projects, check out these ways in which <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2015/02/06/londons-most-unusual-phone-boxes/" target="_blank">London phone boxes are being reused</a>. We especially love the Solar Box, pictured above, a solar powered way of recharging your phone.

Finally, as a reminder (if you needed one) of London&#8217;s ever-changing environment, we tell the stories of ten of <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/2015/02/27/londons-lost-railway-tube-stations/" target="_blank">London&#8217;s lost railway and tube stations</a>. How many of them did you know about already?

Lots more happening in March, so keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.insider-london.co.uk/blog/" target="_blank">Insider London blog</a>.
