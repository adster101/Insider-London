It is never too early to get your children interested in history, and London is the perfect place to begin their love affair with all things antiquated. Here are just a few of the great places to visit on a child-friendly tour of the capital. 

 

## National History Museum 

 

The [National History Museum](http://www.nhm.ac.uk) is literally bursting with exciting things for children to see and do. Whether your youngsters are in to dinosaurs, space, nature, biology or history, you’ll find plenty of attractions and exhibits here.  

 

The free-to-enter museum is open every day between 10:00 and 17:00 and is located in the heart of London’s museum centre, so you can explore other exhibitions nearby. 

 

## Tower of London 

 

The [Tower of London](https://www.hrp.org.uk/tower-of-london/) is legendary and children become mesmerised by hearing the exciting tales that took place here and seeing some of the royal building’s most precious assets, namely the Crown Jewels. 

 

There are nearly 24,000 gemstones situated in the Tower of London, making this exhibit one of its highlights. However, it is also renowned for its historic re-enactments, from sword-fighting shows to live musical performances, situated in the famous Tower moat.
