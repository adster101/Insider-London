At Insider London, we’ve always believed that the most powerful learning happens when classrooms meet the real world. Our new podcast series — [Insider London Podcast](https://www.insiderlondon.com/podcast/) — takes this mission further, bringing together employers, educators, and innovators to explore how graduates can thrive in a rapidly changing global economy.
  
From immersive tech and agri‑tech to employer branding and internationalisation, our guests have shared practical advice for students, universities and employers.

#### What we’ve covered so far

Across the series a few consistent themes keep returning: the gap between academic preparation and workplace expectations; the rising importance of soft skills, curiosity and cultural agility; and the need for university–industry partnerships that produce ready‑to‑work graduates. Our guests have been generous with practical advice — from how to design industry‑aligned modules to what employers look for in a crowded graduate market.

#### Guest highlights and core insights

**Ken Valledy** explored how startup culture and entrepreneurial mindsets can reshape employability, stressing resilience and hands‑on exposure.  
**Michael Korn** explained the realities of scaling hardware — how design thinking must meet manufacturing, logistics and persistence.  
**Mihai Toma** spoke about design graduates and study abroad, arguing that international experience and portfolio work help creatives stand out.  
**Oscar Sadler** of Wiser unpacked employer branding and Gen Z talent, explaining why “ready‑to‑work” programmes and transparent AI guidance are becoming standard.  
**Sam Hall** from Mixed Reality Rooms described the soft‑skill gap and why curiosity, tenacity and international exposure are decisive for immersive‑tech roles.  
**Dr Chris Knight** traced a path from PhD research to agri‑tech entrepreneurship, emphasising impact, personal projects and the confidence gap researchers face when commercialising ideas.  
**Matt Khory** reflected on internationalisation and how study abroad can be career‑defining when it combines depth, rigor and network.  
**Aldo Bunara** of IBS Americas described project‑based learning, long‑term partner building and how short, intensive programs can deliver measurable ROI for students and employers.

#### Upcoming episodes and new voices

**Mia Jafari** of Fluid Labs will join us to discuss turning creative ideas into scalable innovations and why skills must be continuously updated in the era of AI and emerging technologies. **Rory Brimmer** from Turo UK will bring a commercial and partnerships perspective on what platform businesses need from early‑career talent and how students can position themselves for roles in fast‑moving marketplaces. Stephanie Rogers will share a mission‑driven view from sustainable protein and biotech, focusing on how technical expertise pairs with commercial and regulatory know‑how.


#### Why These Conversations Matter

Across all episodes, one theme stands out: graduates need more than theory. They need practical skills, cultural agility, and the ability to adapt to technologies like AI. Employers, meanwhile, are seeking authentic partnerships with universities and innovative ways to connect with talent.  

This is exactly why Insider London runs [Company Visits](https://www.insiderlondon.com/london/company-visits/) — giving students direct exposure to businesses, industries, and leaders. And it’s why our podcast exists: to share these conversations more widely, bridging education and industry for a global audience.
