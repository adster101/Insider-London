1. It may be cold and it could snow this Christmas, but that shouldn’t stop you from taking a little tour on the Thames. Especially when there’s food involved. [City Cruises](http://www.citycruises.com/city-cruises-experiences-special-events-christmas-day-cruise.aspx) will be running special boat tours and even a Christmas party on Christmas Day. Prices range from £15 &#8211; £115, depending on when you choose to sail the Thames.

2. No Christmas itinerary would be complete without a stroll through the streets to see all the lights. It’s also, of course, the cheapest way to celebrate the holidays. You can even get your holiday shopping done! Carnaby Street, Oxford Street,  and Covent Garden are some of the most popular sites to see.

3. Starting November 15th, the [Southbank Centre Christmas Market](http://www.xmas-markets.com/) at the London Eye will be open. There are plenty of browsable stands, decorative lights, food, carollers, and even a visit from Santa Claus! There’s also the [Belgravia Christmas Sunday at Elizabeth Street and Pimlico Road](http://www.visitlondon.com/things-to-do/event/33511011-belgravia-christmas-sunday-at-elizabeth-street-and-pimlico-road), where you can browse gifts ranging from jewellery to home interior while watching jugglers and listening to trumpeteers.

4. Starting November 22nd, [Syon Park](http://www.enchantedwoodland.com/) will open their gates for their annual Enchanted Woodland event. The event will be open every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday from 5:00pm to 8:00pm until December 8th. Tickets are only £7.00 for adults and £3.00 for children. The walks, on average, take around an hour, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes and warm clothes!

5. From November 29th to January 5th, the Soho Theatre is showing “a darkly magical, weird and wonderful Christmas musical” entitled [The Night Before Christmas](http://www.sohotheatre.com/whats-on/the-night-before-christmas/). Tickets range from £15 to £25, depending on which day you choose to attend.

6. [Ice Skating at The Natural History Museum](http://www.redonline.co.uk/travel/what-s-on/natural-history-museum-ice-rink): The ice rink will be set up until January 5th 2014, so you’ll have plenty of time to grab your skates and glide on the museum’s 950 square-metre rink. But if you’re not ready to show off your skating skills, why not take some time and view the grand Christmas tree or sing along to some Christmas music.

7. From November 14th to January 5th, [Somerset House](http://www.somersethouse.org.uk/ice-rink/times-and-tickets) will be opening their ice rinks to the public. Time slots run for an hour each and start at 10, or you can book a day ticket which must be purchased on-site.

8. There are only a few dates left, so you should book your tickets for [The Nutcracker at The Royal House Opera](http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/the-nutcracker-by-peter-wright). The classic  play, accompanied by Tchaikovsky’s score, follows the story of a young girl whose enchanted Christmas present takes her on an adventure.

9. [Hyde Park Winter Wonderland](http://www.hydeparkwinterwonderland.com/attractions) is an actual winter wonderland. Inside the park, you’ll find an ice rink, the Magical Ice Kingdom, and even a circus! The wonderland opened November 22nd and runs until January 5th, and starts each day at 10. What’s even more wonderful about the winter wonderland is that admission is free. Bring all of your little elf friends to visit Santa or take a trip on the giant observation wheel.

13. What’s better than dressing up in a Santa Suit and gallivanting around London pubs for an entire evening? Apparently nothing, since there are quite a few going on this season. [<p dir="ltr">
