This summer, [the Royal Academy](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/about-the-ra) held their spectacular 250th Summer Exhibition. This glorious celebration of “art made now” was curated by the one-and-only [Grayson Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayson_Perry) who boasted the [“biggest, brightest and most colourful Summer Exhibition yet”](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/exhibition/summer-exhibition-2018).

 

The collection of more than 1,300 artworks included big names such as [Tracey Emin](http://www.traceyeminstudio.com/), [David Hockney](http://www.davidhockney.co/) and [Mike Nelson](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/mike-nelson-4020) sitting side by side with rising stars. The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition upholds its rich tradition as the world's longest-running and largest open-submission show.  

 

Formed in 1768 by an act of King George III, and founded by a passionate group of artists and architects, the Academy was formed to promote visual art to the British public and as a means for artists to promote their work independently. The Academy was established as a venue for exhibitions, lectures and classes and during the time of it's first President, [Joshua Reynolds](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joshua-Reynolds), the institution was confined to cramped quarters in Pall Mall.  

 

After a stint in Somerset House and as part of the National Gallery, in 1868 the Academy moved to the stunning grade-II listed [Burlington House](http://burlingtonhouse.org/) - a must-visit for fans of [Palladian architecture](https://www.architecture.com/knowledge-and-resources/knowledge-landing-page/palladianism)
