The Avon and Somerset Constabulary is instantly recognisable as a piece of Banksy. It dates to 2001 and was shown at his first major exhibition in the UK â€“ The Severnshed show in 2000. It&#8217;s currently on display at Sotheby&#8217;s, part of <a href="http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/2014/banksy-steve-lazarides-ls1403.html" target="_blank">BANKSY: The Unauthorised Retrospective</a>, curated by Steve Lazarides.
