I&#8217;m one of those people that becomes interested in certain sports for about a 3 to 4 week period immediately after that particular sport&#8217;s most prestigious tournament has been on TV. Awful isn&#8217;t it? Yes it is. After Wimbledon I love tennis, after the Ashes I love cricket, and after the Olympics I love everything except sailing which quite simply is not a spectator sport. At the moment, having just watched Europe win the Ryder Cup, I love golf (patriotism is marvellously fickle isn&#8217;t it? English one minute, British the next, and now European. All that&#8217;s left is for earth to take on another planet is some sort of sporting tournament).

    Golf is hard to play. In many ways. It literally is hard to play; a tiny ball that has to be hit a really long way into a tiny hole. But it&#8217;s also expensive, and if you&#8217;re in London, it&#8217;s incredibly difficult to find somewhere to play that isn&#8217;t frighteningly exclusive or doesn&#8217;t require you to dress like Rupert the Bear (although the R the B look is about to hit Brick Lane big time). Search golf in London and you&#8217;ll find courses like <a href="http://dulwichgolf.co.uk/">Dulwich Golf Club</a>. I wouldn&#8217;t even get past the gates.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    So what do I do? Well, I&#8217;ve established two excellent options for people who have either rarely played before, can&#8217;t be bothered with the etiquette, don&#8217;t have a golfing handicap, or, like me, will lose interest as soon as the Euros (football) begin&#8230;

    OK to make clear, there are two types of Urban golf. One is where people, within urban areas, place balls on small green mats and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_golf">aim for bins and derelict buildings</a>. This is a real, if ridiculous, thing, apparently enjoyed the world over. The Urban golf I&#8217;m referring to however, is a golf simulator. You can play at venues in Soho, Smithfield or Kensington. You do hit balls, into a screen, which then simulates where your ball will go according to your swing on a variety of famous courses. Each venue has a bar, and the whole thing is very relaxed and terrific fun. And most of all, as Urban Golf tell you, they are strictly &#8216;non-denimphobic&#8217;.

    This is an actual golf club, complete with driving range, clubhouse, a 9-hole course and Range Rovers in the car park. But, most importantly, there is absolutely no dress code, and no minimum experience required. I recently played with my friend Dom, who looked, if you could imagine, like the opposite of a golfer, and yet as he asked questions like &#8216;Can I just use a driver for every shot?&#8217;, they didn&#8217;t even bat an eyelid. The sign outside might as well read &#8216;London Golf Centre: Philistines welcome&#8217;. But it&#8217;s great. It&#8217;s evidently not the best golf course in the world, and I noticed some key differences between this course and Augusta. For example, Augusta&#8217;s greens tend not to have mushrooms thriving on them, and the clubhouse probably doesn&#8217;t serve cheesy chips. But it&#8217;s cheap, friendly, and anyone can enjoy it. And best of all, it&#8217;s in Zone 2. Besides, why shouldn&#8217;t I be able to play golf? I never stopped golfers playing football on the horrible bit of grass at my local park when I was a kid. We all need to share and share alike.

    So you can play golf in London. And who knows, if you&#8217;re good and not pathetically fickle like me, you might even be able to get a membership somewhere. But even as I write this I&#8217;m already getting bored of golf. It&#8217;s old news, what with the Snooker World Championship just a few short months away. Suddenly it all makes sense. Snooker. That&#8217;s my sport. And you don&#8217;t even have to go outside.
