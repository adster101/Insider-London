Knightsbridge in London is well known for its elegant architecture which has come to symbolise the district’s luxury department stores. The neighbourhood is inhabited by many celebrities from the world of fashion and entertainment, as well as being a hot spot for wealthy clientele drawn to the lavish jewellery and cocktail bars. 

 

Harrods is known for being an innovative player in the retail landscape of London, and over the years it has worked with significant figures in the luxury fashion world. Which is why it is particularly interesting to hear their accounts in a new web series, produced by Harrods and reported on by [PSFK Retail Intelligence](https://www.psfk.com/2018/06/harrods-london-legacy.html), to "emphasise the evolving experiential elements of shopping at the department store."  

 

Eye-catching displays and majestic interiors, which [celebrate a particular season](https://www.harrods-media.com/campaigns/news/420), have become synonymous with the department store. Which is why the news of architect Laura Gonzalez working alongside Bernard Pictet Atelier, a famous French architectural glass designer, on refurbishing the [Cartier boutique](https://www.harrods-media.com/campaigns/news/414) earlier this year certainly caught the attention of the interior design world. The two masters in their crafts reimagined a luxurious space, which truly upholds the prestigious jewellery company's vision of precious and timeless luxury goods. 

 

Laura Gonzalez chose to work alongside the Bernard Pictet Atelier as the glazier's vision blends seamlessly with the scale and spirit of the project. Within the boutique, various interpretations of glass walls, metallisation effects and pearled imprint techniques, not to forget the majestic fluted glass chandelier create a distinct artisanal style while being worked in a profoundly modern way. 

 

Echoes of the English Arts and Crafts Movement can be found in smooth woodwork and curved oak panels which intersperse the interior and bring a needed softness and natural aesthetic. The bright, feminine and elegant facade combines bronze and engraved glass to invite customer within and share in the experience. In the men's area, the Atelier designed a 6m/2 glass wall unit which has been engraved and embellished in patinated gold leaf.
