Working with GTEP Education in conjunction with the High Commission of Gujurat, Insider London organised an inspiring 2 day programme for professors from Gujarat universities.



On Wednesday 4th December 2018, Insider London was proud to showcase London innovation with a full day programme. Starting off the day with a [King's Cross walking tour](https://www.insiderlondon.com/london/educational-tours/kings-cross-regeneration/#kings-cross-innovation-and-regeneration), our guides explored the UK's biggest regeneration programme, and how the area has transformed into an exciting destination which prioritises the public realm and attracts world-leading corporates such as Google.





In the afternoon, we headed east – into London's vibrant hub of technology and creativity. The group visited the CEO of one of the world's leading luxury marketing agencies, [Verb](http://verbbrands.com) who boast clients such as Jimmy Choo and Sunseeker. Next, we ventured deeper into London's “Tech City” with an in-depth business visit to [Innovation Warehouse](http://www.innovationwarehouse.org/) a leading City of London accelerator programme for high growth digital start-ups.

On Friday 6th December we met again for a visit to the highly-prestigious [Tribal Worldwide](http://www.tribalworldwide.co.uk). Working with leading brands such as BA, McDonalds, Adidas and Volkswagen, Tribal Worldwide provides the highest-performing marketing to enhance the customer experience from start to finish. Darren Savage, the Chief Strategy Officer, gave the group an in-depth presentation on the ethos and mentality of Tribal Worldwide, followed by Adam Powers, the Chief Customer Experience Officer who gave fantastic insight into the agency's everyday work. Jayati Sareen, the Account Manager for Volkswagen, took the group step-by-step through the customer experience process before a lively Q&A session with the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Liles. It was a truly memorable experience for all.











In the afternoon, our programme was rounded off with a fun and interactive leadership workshop with a highly-qualified facilitator. Exploring carefully-selected examples of different types of leaders as well as changing attitudes to leadership through time, this session paired theory with delegate interaction and practical application.
