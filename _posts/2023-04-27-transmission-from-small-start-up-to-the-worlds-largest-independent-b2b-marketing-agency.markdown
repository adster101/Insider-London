In the world of marketing, [Transmission](https://transmissionagency.com/en-gb) is a name that has quickly risen to become a major player.

##### From Pulse to Pace to Transmission

In 2013, Pulse was established as a media and content marketing agency solely working with technology businesses. Three years later, in 2016, they launched their German B2B tech agency called Pace. The following year, in 2017, Transmission was born as a B2B non-tech agency.

In 2018, Pulse, Pace, and Transmission continued to scale, winning multiple awards and accolades for their client work. Work started to become more global, and they began to eye up new international offices to open. The following year, in 2019, the US, Singapore, and Australia offices launched. All companies rebranded as Transmission, and with their international growth, it was important to reposition the agency with one goal and one set of values.
