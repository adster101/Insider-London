Next week we will be joinig a host of other London tour guides, with the aim of raising ££20,000 for the MS Trust in just 20 hours. The [20in20 ](https://www.20in20.london)fundraiser will raise money by offering guided tours around the city, for a small fee. \
\
On Thursday 25 May you will be able to pick from around 45 guided tours of London throughout the day. The tours costs from as little as Â£20 and this money will give you the opportunity to gain a unique insight into the city, whilst raising money for a truly worthy cause. \
\
Ans Vaessen, one of the Insider London tour guides, was diagnosed with MS nearly ten years ago. Along with Heleen van Schoonhoven- whose father suffers with the disease too, this amazing fundraising initiative was born. \
\
If you want to take part and help Ans and Heleen raise £20,000 in just 20 hours all you have to do is [book a tour](https://www.20in20.london/index.html#walks) now. From morning, afternoon and evening walks, to cycle, private and bespoke tours there's something for everyone. There will also be accessible tours throughout the day for those in wheelchairs or with visual impairments.
