Drawing attention to the badger is this David and Goliath piece by Argentinian street artist Martin Ron on the side of Village Underground, Shoreditch. On arriving in the UK, he saw newspaper headlines discussing the controversial badger cull being trialled in areas of the country. Why is it called David and Goliath? Well in this case, the badger is Goliath and David&#8217;s hand is meant to symbolise Prime Minister David Cameron.

The mural drew further attention to the issue, receiving attention from &#8211; amongst others &#8211; <a href="http://www.brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssbsep13a.html#16" target="_blank">Brian May</a>. You can read the full story of the piece and an interview with Martin Ron on <a href="http://streetartlondon.co.uk/blog/2013/08/28/badgergate-martin-ron-paints-the-vu-wall-2/#more-4381%20â€¦" target="_blank">Street Art London</a>.
