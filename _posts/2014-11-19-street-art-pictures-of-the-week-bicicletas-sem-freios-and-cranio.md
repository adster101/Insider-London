We&#8217;re heading to Brazil for this week&#8217;s street art pictures &#8211; well, as close as you can get to South America without leaving London, that is. And these pictures live up to their county&#8217;s reputation for colourful, expressive work.

The first amazing piece is the work of Bicicleta Sem Freio (translating as &#8220;Bicycle Without Breaks&#8221;). BSF met while studying visual art at the Federal University of Goias. They created the work on a wall near Brick Lane, shown above and below, over three days.

We&#8217;re pairing their work with Cranio &#8211; [whose work we featured on the blog before](/cranio-street-art-rivington-street-shoreditch/) &#8211; whose colourful figures also carry a political implication. This piece can be found close-by on Brick Lane itself, was originally created in August last year, and touched up in July of this year: just about the time Brazil was making global headlines thanks to the World Cup.
