This St. Patrick's Day, do something different: On 17th March, 7pm, join us in your greenest garments – or at least with a twinkle in your eye – for a special edition of our History of Drinking & Pubs Tour in the City of London!

For an Irish twist on this Insider London classic, we will be pulling up a stool at a world-famous Irish pub with a seven-hundred year history! Experience the Irish-pub craze that swept the world and the origins of the stout in the original deal - the first “Irish pub” outside of Ireland. Discover its fascinating story, as well as those of three other unique establishments as we venture through London's most ancient district and tradition - boozing - on a pub tour with a difference.

See you on St. Patrick's Day!
