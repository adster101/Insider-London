Here at Insider London our eyes are always open to the hottest new retail trends. With three contrasting branches of our dynamic Retail Design Tour: [West End](/tours/retail-design/), [East End](/tours/east-end-retail-design-tour/) and [Brixton](/tours/brixton-retail-design-tour/), we are always on the look out for the most exciting and innovative concept stores and lifestyle brands to hit London's ever-fashionable streets. Here are our top five concept stores: 

 

1. [L'Occitane](https://uk.loccitane.com/regent-street-flagship-store,83,1,89566,1089304.htm) 74-76 Regent St, Soho, London W1B 5RL  

 

 

L'Occitane's beautiful [flagshig store](https://uk.loccitane.com/regent-street-flagship-store,83,1,89566,1089304.htm) on Regents Street is a multi-sensory haven of tranquility. Be transported to gorgeous Provence as the scent of lavender wafts through the two-level interior. Don't miss the upstairs “selfie-studio” and hand massage centre (massages are free via online booking [https://bookings.qudini.com/booking-widget/storebooker/HJ831G9NRT5/2862/product/41152](https://bookings.qudini.com/booking-widget/storebooker/HJ831G9NRT5/2862/product/41152)).  

 

Having teamed up with the iconic artesan, Pierre Hermes, exclusive macaroons are available in store with three flavours corresponding to fragranced L'Occitane hand creams! 

 

 

 

 

 

## 2. [The Shop at Bluebird] (https://theshopatbluebird.com)
 Carriage Hall, 29 Floral Street, London WC2E 9DP  

 

Having firmly closed its art deco doors on the Kings Road,  The Shop at Bluebird has been welcomed into [Covent Garden](https://www.drapersonline.com/news/first-look-the-shop-at-bluebird-opens-in-covent-garden/7030373.article). Housed in a gorgeous, retro-fitted coach-house on [Floral Street](https://theshopatbluebird.com/floral-street/), the appropriately-botanical interior is a modern curiosity cabinet with fashion, books, music, homeware and a delicious restaurant all under one historic glass roof.  

 

Take careful note of the edgy modern art installations set against the original beams and pulleys of the carriageway! 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

## 3. [Nike Lab](https://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/c/nikelab) 
477-478 Bateman's Row Rd, London EC2A 3HH  

 
Hidden away in the Shoreditch backstreets is the exclusive Nike Labs – one of only six locations, world-wide. This futuristic boutique, under the re-purposed railway arches of Bateman Row, houses a carefully curated selection of the most cutting-edge Nike special editions and collaborations. With the floor made from recycled trainer rubber under the [Nike Grind](https://www.nike.com/gb/en_gb/c/innovation/grind) initiative, and disused disk drives making up the display structures, this is unlike any Nike store you've ever seen, and has been voted [“The Coolest Shop in Shoreditch”](https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/nike-lab-shoreditch-opening)) 

 

For that one-of-a-kind purchase, head upstairs to meet the Nike designers, and create a completely bespoke shoe. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

## 4. [House of Hackney](https://www.houseofhackney.com/) 
131 Shoreditch High St, London E1 6JE, UK  

 

 
Tipped to be [the next Liberty's](https://www.timeout.com/london/shopping/house-of-hackney-1) by Time Out, House of Hackney was founded in 2010 by a husband and wife duo, determined to break rules and bring fun and colour to interior design. With their bold “modern maximalism” style combined with quaint English nostalgia, House of Hackney, is re-working traditional English interiors for the modern generation. Keep an eye out for their [exclusive new collection]((https://www.houseofhackney.com/william-morris/coming-soon), in partnership with the William Morris gallery.

 

[Check out prints](https://www.houseofhackney.com/wallpaper.html) like Dalston Rose, Queen Bee and Hackney Empire and discover why everyone's raving about this East End boutique! 

 

 

 

 

 

## 5. [Article Brixton](https://www.urbanexcess.com/pages/stores)
61 Atlantic Rd, Brixton, London SW9 8PU, UK  

 

 

Another railway arch treasure is Article Brixton, just a stone's throw away from the famous [Brixton Market](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/brixton-retail-design-tour/). Away from the bustling crowds at their other branch in Spitalfields, browse the latest streetware collection, including collections by Herschel and Levi. The industrial-chic interior is minimal and stylish, providing the perfect backdrop for the online retailer's second brick and mortar space. 

 

Don't miss the [meticulously colour-coded shoe section](https://www.timeout.com/london/shopping/article-brixton), hidden at first glance from the main entrance!
