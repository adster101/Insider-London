<p style="text-align: left;">
  If you&#8217;ve ever looked enviously upon New York&#8217;s High Line or Paris&#8217; Promenade Plantee, this new proposal for the <a href="http://peckhamcoalline.strikingly.com/">Peckham Coal Line</a> is sure to capture your imagination.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The Coal Line would create a new 1km elevated park, linking Queen&#8217;s Road Peckham and Rye Lane, using the currently disused Rickett Coal Sidings. Like its equivalents around the world, the scheme offers a way of maximising the green space in a heavily built up urban area. It also fits with other community-led projects looking to reshape this area of south London.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  But, as well as providing all the usual benefits associated with parks, the creator of the scheme Nick Woodford also argues it will be help people move through the area &#8211; especially as it links up two parts of the national cycle network.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  And, although it perhaps won&#8217;t be the same tourist attraction as the High Line, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_Bridge">the Garden Bridge</a> when built, another factor in its favour is its relatively low cost, an estimated £2 million (compared to the £175 million linked to the Garden Bridge.
</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  The idea is still in its very early stages but momentum seems to be growing &#8211; you can follow the project on <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckhamCoalLine" target="_blank">Twitter</a> for the latest or <a href="http://peckhamcoalline.strikingly.com" target="_blank">take a look on their website for more information</a>.
