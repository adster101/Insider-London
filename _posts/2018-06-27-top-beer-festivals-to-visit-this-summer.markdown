It’s no secret that craft beers and ales have had a major resurgence in recent years, and that means that beer festivals are becoming ever more popular.

Of course, London is home to a number of such events and with the long summer evenings stretching ahead, there’s no better time to visit the capital and go to a beer festival. [Londonist](https://londonist.com/london/drink/the-best-beer-festivals-in-london-in-june-2018) has picked out some of the top events coming up in June, including London Brewers Alliance Beer Festival, which showcases the beers produced in London breweries.

This particular event is being hosted at the Fuller’s Brewery in Chiswick on 23rd June. Some 40 breweries will be attending this year and sharing their brews with those who attend - ideal if you’re keen to sample local ales and beers.

In August, meanwhile, the [Great British Beer Festival](https://olympia.london/whatson/great-british-beer-festival) will return to the city, when it will showcase over 900 real ales, craft beers, ciders, perries and much more. It’s taking place at Olympia and always draws a crowd.

But while it’s all well and good sampling different beers, you might want to learn more about the history of brewing in London, as well as visit some of the city’s most iconic watering holes.

A London history tour that takes you on a journey to some of the capital’s most famous and historic pubs, as well as enlightening you about [brewing in London](https://www.insider-london.co.uk/tours/history-of-drinking-and-pubs/) and how it has changed the city over the centuries is the perfect way to spend an afternoon and get you in the mood for visiting one of London’s beer festivals.
