Over the past few years, East London or more specifically Shoreditch, has become know as the hub of technological and digital innovation. Thea area otherwise known as Silicon Roundabout has become home to a whole host of diverse business ventures and startups.

And to represent this, The Stage Shoreditch have now designed this [interactive map](http://www.thestageshoreditch.com/tech-city-shoreditch) of the area. Each mark on the map represents an HQ or main office of a company. By looking at the photo above, you'll see in the photo above that each pin point marks a notable business or start up from this area. To make it easier for you to search, you can filter companies by sector, type, size, founded and startup.

By clicking on a company this map provides you will information about each company, including number of employees, the address, the logo, the type of business that it is, as well as their website and social media handles.
