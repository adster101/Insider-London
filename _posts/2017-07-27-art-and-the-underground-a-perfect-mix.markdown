It can be easy to think of the London Underground as little more than a subterranean transport system that, while a quintessential part of the London experience, isn’t always the most pleasant place to go in the city.

But if you aren’t in a rush and are able to enjoy some of the sights around London’s tube stations you may notice a whole new side to this iconic network of underground railway lines.

Earlier this month, the [Evening Standard](http://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/arts/london-summer-art-map-a-guide-to-spotting-art-when-youre-out-and-about-in-the-capital-a3579306.html) picked out some of the highlights on Transport for London’s latest Summer Art Map, with plenty of incredible works of art to be seen in tube stations around the capital, if you just take the time to look.

If you really love your art, going on London underground tours is [the best way to not only see these stunning pieces](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/), but also to learn the history and stories behind them.

For example, the ticket hall at Tottenham Court Road sports the work of Daniel Buren, while a piece by Jacqueline Poncelet can be found at Edgware Road. Journey to Blackhorse Road station, meanwhile, and you’ll be treated to “tessellating tile designs” by Giles Round, the newspaper added. 

Interestingly, the Metropolitan Line was named by commuters as the [route that got them feeling the most creative](http://www.insider-london.co.uk/london-underground-tours-which-tube-lines-provide-the-greatest-inspiration/), while the Circle and Waterloo and City lines were named as the least inspiring in a recent survey. 

Whether you’re on a tour or are riding the underground to get from A to B, if you take the time to look around you at each station you’ll quickly see that the stops are more than just functional transport hubs, with works of art dotted throughout the network.
