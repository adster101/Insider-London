As architects step up to one of the greatest challenges in history, we look at the buildings **pioneering** our transition to a green future. Buildings use an estimated 40% of our **global energy** needs so come and examine the sustainable features of some of London’s **most iconic skyscrapers**.

From energy and water savings to carbon-free commuting and renewable materials, both the construction and operations of buildings are examined. This is an exciting time for engineers and architects who consider brand new solutions and combine the latest in **innovative design and exciting new technology**.  

With many factors at play, the challenges faced by architects in London are unique. The City of London hosts some of London’s most recognisable and impressive skyscrapers but also upholds some of the world’s tightest planning regulations. How are the leading "starchitects" of our times balancing these challenges?

We examine some of the capital’s most distinctive towers which boast green credentials and explore how the built environment is adapting to the needs of our time.

**Meeting Point**: Outside the Andaz Hotel, Liverpool Street

**Finishing Point**: Outside the Bloomberg Building, near Bank Station

**On this green tour you will discover:**
* A wide variety of approaches to sustainability
* The key principles behind **sustainable building certification**
* A new side to some of London’s best-loved buildings
* The only building in the world to have **integrated wind turbines**
* The conflict between **heritage preservation** and the drive for progress
* The world’s most **innovative and sustainable office** building
