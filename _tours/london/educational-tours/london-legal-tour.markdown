Join us on this fascinating journey through London’s legal quarter, from medieval taverns and debtor courts to the global role of English common law in today’s business world. Discover how centuries of tradition, training, and precedent have shaped London into the world’s premier centre for legal services.

Led by our expert guide, this two-hour walking tour uncovers the hidden courtyards and historic institutions of the Inns of Court, the Royal Courts of Justice, and the legal quarter that connects **commerce in the City** with **government in Westminster**. You’ll learn not just about barristers and wigs, but about how law underpins business, finance, and global trade.

**Meeting Point:** Holborn Underground Station
**Finishing Point:** Holborn Underground Station (via the Old Curiosity Shop)

On this legal walking tour, you will discover:

* **Lincoln’s Inn Fields** – London’s largest square and the roots of modern legal reform.
* **Debtors’ Court & Carey Street** – why bankruptcy once meant prison, and how insolvency law became a cornerstone of modern business.
* **Lincoln’s Inn, Inner Temple & Middle Temple** – the historic Inns of Court where barristers have trained for centuries, from Shakespeare’s day to the present.
* **The Royal Courts of Justice** – Victorian Gothic grandeur, still home to international commercial disputes worth billions.

Throughout the tour, you’ll see how **London’s legal system has evolved from medieval guilds to a global legal export industry** — and why businesses worldwide continue to choose English law to govern their contracts.
