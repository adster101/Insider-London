Got it — I’ll adapt it into a circular tour format (starting and finishing at Stratford), and rewrite the whole description cleanly in Markdown. Here’s the updated version:


In 2012, all eyes were on London as the world gathered at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. The Games were a phenomenal success, but the real story began after the last medal had been awarded. More than a decade later, the Olympic Park stands as one of the most ambitious urban regeneration projects in Europe, transforming East London into a thriving district where sport, culture, business, and technology meet.

This tour traces the 13-year legacy of the Olympics, showing how the area has continued to evolve. From world-class sporting venues and bold new housing developments to creative and tech industries, the Park is now a symbol of long-term transformation and community renewal.

The most exciting recent addition is East Bank, London’s brand-new cultural quarter. Here you’ll find world-class institutions like the BBC, Sadler’s Wells, UCL, the London College of Fashion, and the V&A, all working together in one vibrant district. It’s a landmark project that ensures the Olympic legacy is not just remembered, but lived every day.

On the tour you will discover:

* Why one of the largest shopping malls in Europe was built in this once-neglected area

* The elegant silhouette of the world’s greatest public swimming baths

* The conflicts and tensions with a certain Premier League football club

* How the Olympic Village became London’s newest postcode

* The rise of one of the UK’s most important technology clusters on the Park’s doorstep


Meeting and Finishing Point: Westfield exit of Stratford Tube Staton
