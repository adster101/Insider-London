As famously once stated "**Britain is a nation of shopkeepers**" – so come and explore London’s most successful retail districts with Insider London. Our award-winning retail tours sample the coolest and most interesting shops that London has to offer.

We visit **London’s trendiest district** where shabby chic reigns supreme and explore how Shoreditch has become one of the most fashionable commercial zones in London.
