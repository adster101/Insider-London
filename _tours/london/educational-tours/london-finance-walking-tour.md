Follow the towering pinnacles of JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, HSBC, KPMG, Credit Suisse, EY, Thomson Reuters and many more.

The Estate now comprises around 16,000,000 square feet (1,500,000 m2) of office and retail space where around 105,000 people work. Complete with extravagant residences, beautiful parks, public artwork and five different shopping malls, **Canary Wharf has become a luxurious destination with world-class economic status.**
