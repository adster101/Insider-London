This award-winning tour uncovers the hidden stories of London's iconic skyline. Explore how the world's top architects **merge the historic and the innovative** in their race to the skies. Emerge yourself in the controversies of the architectural world, from questions of heritage to sustainability.

In **two hours**, we journey through the latest architectural developments of the City of London, starting at St Paul’s and finishing at the many "kitchen items" of the Eastern cluster.

In **three and a half hours**, this in-depth journey begins with the artistic jewels of Southwark before crossing over into the City of London. In this version we stop mid-way to refuel where our guides will show you one of the best views in London over a quick coffee break.

**On this tour you will discover**

* The most striking examples of modern architecture in London and the fascinating stories behind their development
* The importance of sustainability in London’s architecture and the dynamic modern developments pushing the sustainability envelope
* How architects marry London’s innovative and historic architectural styles, including, a building which integrates an ancient churchyard
* The controversial modern buildings that have had critics up in arms, including the building branded ‘ugly’ by the head of the Tate Modern art gallery, the development likened to a sea-sponge, and a sky scraper, which given the right weather conditions, can melt a car’s interior
* A futuristic (and formerly very wobbly) London footbridge (in 3.5 hour version)
* The distinctive styles and characteristic design traits of influential British architects, including Will Alsop, Richard Rogers and Sir Norman Foster
* What’s next for London’s iconic skyline
