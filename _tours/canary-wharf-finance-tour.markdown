Tour of Canary Wharf – the New Finance Centre of London takes you around and inside the amazing development that is east London’s most pivotal, and important, business district CANARY WHARF.

After the traditional City of London, Canary Wharf is the second main financial centre within the United Kingdom and contains many of Europe's tallest buildings, including the second-tallest in the UK - One Canada Square.

Whilst mighty on its effects on the UK and European economy Canary Wharf is contained in a relatively small area, an area which represents a fascinating example of on-going urban regeneration. The fact is over the last 30 years Canary Wharf has been transformed from a run-down disregarded part of London to become one of the world’s leading financial centres. Comprising originally of nothing more than unwanted marshland and redundant nineteenth century docks Canary Wharf now boast some of the most expensive real-estate in the world.

Canary Wharf now contains around 16,000,000 square feet (1,500,000 m2) of office and retail space where around 105,000 people work. It is home to the world or European headquarters of numerous major banks, professional services firms and media organisations including Barclays, Citigroup, Clifford Chance, Credit Suisse, EY, Fitch Ratings, HSBC, Infosys, J.P. Morgan, KPMG, MetLife, Moody's, Morgan Stanley, RBC, S&P Global, Skadden, State Street and Thomson Reuters.

On our comprehensive tour we will walk past the spectacular buildings occupied by these major companies, explore the substantial relics of the past and experience the powerful energy that is generated by this world class hub of global commerce.

Unlike our other traditional Finance tour of the City of London our Canary Wharf finance tour instead takes us out to the ‘new kid on the block’. London City is still the largest centre of financial trading in the country (& one of the largest in the world) but Canary Wharf is growing fast – aiming to double in size over the next few years. Although Canary Wharf may swap the old-world charm of old London for a 21st century atmosphere it loses nothing in grander and gravitas.

Canary Wharf has excellent transport links, increasing housing and recreation facilities and most importantly it’s free from the restrictive planning policies that operate within the City. All this makes Canary Wharf one the first choices for new firms and even, in many cases, older established firms such as Barclays who, to accommodate their future growth plans, want to build first class facilities that they require when they need them, without added complications of having to be watchful about such matters as damaging archaeological remains.

## Highlights

On this tour you will:

- See the stunning architecture that is being added to almost daily
- View amazing works of modern art
- Find out about how the re-generation & development  of this previously run-down area was planned, financed and built – including what obstacles were faced on the journey
- Hear the stories about the winners and losers as the high stakes game of the development  progressed
- Discover why it’s called Canary Wharf and how it once was the busiest port in the world
Consider what the future holds for this critical part of the UK economy

Our tour takes in most of the Canary Wharf estate. On this tour you will see what bold design and courageous planning can produce in a the way of an exciting and energising space where now over 100,000 people work, live and play. We’ll visit thriving shopping centres and pass the many pubs and restaurants catering for the needs of visitors and workers alike.

You’ll see No. 1 Canary Wharf, for a while the tallest building in the UK, you will visit the award-winning station (now amazingly the same size as No. 1 Canary Wharf) which feature in the movie Star Wars and you will observe more big bank headquarters than you thought possible. At the same time witness some surprisingly peaceful parks with views over the Thames and the Millennium Dome – it really is a packed, informative and fun few hours.
