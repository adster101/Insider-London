The UK’s Digital industry is booming. It’s epicentre – an unassuming roundabout in East London.

Known as Silicon Roundabout or Tech City, this area of London is home to the world’s third biggest start-up tech cluster and is currently snapping at the heels of New York City and San Francisco’s tech scene.

Last year Silicon Roundabout launched over 15,500 new businesses – nearly five times as many launched in Canary Wharf. It is also where some of the biggest tech companies in the world have put down roots, including heavy hitters Google and Amazon, alongside Zoopla, Asos, Moo, Spotify, Songkick.com, Mind Candy and more.

But how did this tech start-up metropolis come about?

Award-winning Insider London’s walking tour offers an eye-opening educational insight into how Shoreditch spawned a tech monster to rival San Fran’s Silicon Valley.

### London’s Silicon Roundabout – Best Shoreditch Walking Tour

Starting at Shoreditch Grind, a funky little coffee shop come recording studio, our professional and knowledgeable tour guide will take you on an entertaining two-hour loop via Shoreditch, Hoxton and Old Street through this innovative and vibrant part of London.

Taking in co-worker spaces (where lots of tech start-ups begin), creative spaces, pop-up spaces and some downright crackers spaces, you’ll hear how Silicon Roundabout has earned its global profile before finishing at Google Campus, the UK’s biggest ‘incubator’ for tech minded start-ups.
