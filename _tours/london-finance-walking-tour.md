Join us on our award-winning walking tour of The City as we take you on a fascinating journey to discover the origins of London’s financial centre &#8211; from its humble beginnings in 17<sup>th</sup> century coffee houses to its ancient and unusual governance and voting system that’s still in use today.

Starting at Panyer Alley, our expert guide will show you how the City of London developed into a global financial centre, taking in key buildings such as, the London Stock Exchange, Guildhall, the Bank of England, Lloyds of London and Rothschild’s, before finishing at Willis, the world’s oldest insurance broker.

- **The myriad of Livery Companies and Freemen** that occupy the City, hear about their role and purpose, both then and now.

- **How the Bank of England pioneered the modern banking system** and why it’s worth its weight in gold and its role in the global financial crisis.
