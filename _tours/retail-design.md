## A Masterclass in Merchandising
<p>Are you seeking design inspiration for your enterprise? Or maybe you want to sample the coolest and most luxurious shops London has to offer? Award-winning Insider London’s tour of beautiful and unusual hand-picked retail spaces is the ultimate masterclass in shopping, store design and visual merchandising.</p>

Over two hours, our expert guide will take you on a sizzling tour of the most inspiring and individual shops in and around central London. From sleek high-tech futuristic spaces, to lavish, lovingly hand-crafted spaces; we will show you over 15 of London’s most stunning shops, stores and eateries.

Hear the stories behind how these burgeoning businesses grew brilliant brands, the challenges they overcame and the growing back lash against ‘faceless’ chain stores.


## An Alternative Shop Tour of London, you will discover:

- **A variety of retail spaces** using ingenious and radical ways to distinguish themselves from soulless ‘cookie-cutter’ shop chains

- **Striking approaches to shop design and visual merchandising**, from achingly trendy minimalist outlets selling limited edition products to shops offering an <em>Alison in Wonderland </em>style immersive experience &#8211; complete with extravagant decor and secret room.

- **The beautiful and chaotic** space Vogue describes as &#8216;the coolest shop on the planet&#8217;

- **An eatery where it rains every thirty minutes**

- **The brand re-writing the design rule book** by making the product the hero

- **A quintessential British brand with an extension** so grand it’s a listed tourist attraction

- **An exquisite gold grotto** and a historic arcade of shops where you daren’t whistle

- **The fascinating back stories behind these brands’ development** and their unique approach to retail design.

Starting in the colourful cafes and department stores of Piccadilly, our retail design walking tour moves through the bustling heart of Soho before taking in the extravagant designer stores of Mayfair. .

This alternative London walking tour is perfect for retail designers, shop owners and students seeking creative inspiration, as well as those who simply want to discover the coolest shops and cafes in the capital. A great introduction to London’s retail hot spots, you can earmark the stores you love and re-visit for a jolly good browse later.
