King’s Cross has a turbulent history: From peaceful rural city escape to industrial freight hub to shady suburb to the up-and-coming area that attracts even Google.

Join us on this tour through its journey and discover how it made its transition. We will look at historical aspects that made King’s Cross to what it was, examine new developments, the philosophy behind them and their impact as well as explore new interesting projects and initiatives – from arts and culture to food to business.
