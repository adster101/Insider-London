The days are getting colder and evening is creeping in earlier, but there is still much to be found in London town, especially the famous East End. Insider London would like to take you into the depths of the East End of London and its incredible history on the East End Crime walking tour. 

The East End is more than Street Art and Jack the Ripper murder sites, it has been coloured by the numerous waves of immigrants who made the area their home. This part of London was notoriously stricken with poverty for centuries which resulted in hardened criminals terrorising the streets. The rookeries, filled to the brim with impoverished workers who often turned to crime just to get by, surrounded the infamous Spitalfields Market. 

From the early riots of the silkweavers to the foul living conditions of the Victorian era when gangs of pick-pockets ran rife; from the more commonly known gangs of the early 20th Century to the recent gentrification which made it a favourite haunt for Londoners. The architecture, alleys, the Spitalfields Market have all been touched by the residents, as well as the pubs. We will duck into some of these famous drinking holes to hear more about the gangs, crime, and harsher times of the East End.

## Highlights of the East End Crime Tour

* The site of Bedlam, the people thrown in for living a life of crime and the criminal methods used by the institution
* Find out the darker history of what ties a saint, a wheel and an alley together
* See one of the oldest shop fronts in London built shortly after the life of a famous criminal of Spitalfields, and stands just a stone’s throw away from his birthplace
* The site where the worst street in London stood which was at one time known to witness a murder a month, and hear the stories of the locals who denied the horrible accusations
* Visit the streets which witnessed Jack the Ripper murders and gangland killings

Helped by its tastes, sights and sounds your Insider guide will take you through the infamous streets around the Spitalfields Market whilst visiting some of the historic pubs. The East End Crime walking tour begins its journey in front of the beautiful Andaz hotel alongside Liverpool Street Station. As your senses are assaulted by the sounds of the hustle and bustle just outside the City boundaries, we will duck down quiet alleys and small hidden streets. The smells from the vast number of eateries may be hard to resist as your Insider guide will take you through the darker history of Spitalfields. We will escape the cold air and drop into a few of the pubs that became the backdrops to the Whitechapel Murders. If you so wish, enjoy the tastes of the local brews as your Insider guide tells tales of the East End: Gangs, Crimes and Harsher Times.
